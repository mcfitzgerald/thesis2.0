	abstract = {The equilibrium [3H]estradiol binding by the partially purified estrogen receptor from calf uteri was measured at 25 degrees C. The Scatchard plot of the binding data showed a convex curve characteristic of positive cooperativity and a Hill coefficient of 1.58 +/- 0.21, at receptor concentrations of 1 to 10 {nM}. Below a receptor concentration of approximately 0.3 {nM} the Scatchard plot approached linearity, suggesting that the cooperative interactions are dependent upon a monomer--dimer equilibrium. Trypsin pretreatment of the receptor resulted in a loss of dimer formation and of the cooperative interactions. The positive cooperative characteristics of the estrogen receptor were shown not to be produced by receptor inactivation, failure to complete the [3H]estradiol--receptor equilibrium reaction, or radioimpurity of the [3H]estradiol. These findings indicate that the activated 5S estrogen receptor is a homodimer and that its formation is associated with a positive cooperative estradiol-binding reaction.},

	abstract = {The estrogen receptor dimerizes and exhibits cooperative ligand binding as part of its normal functioning. Interaction of the estrogen receptor with its ligands is mediated by a C-terminal hormone-binding domain ({HBD}), and residues within the {HBD} are thought to contribute to dimerization. To examine dimer interactions in the isolated {HBD}, a human estrogen receptor {HBD} fragment was expressed in high yield as a cleavable fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The isolated {HBD} peptide exhibited affinity for estradiol, ligand discrimination, and cooperative estradiol binding (Hill coefficient ∼1.6) similar to the full-length protein. Circular dichroism spectroscopy suggests that the {HBD} contains significant amounts of α-helix (∼60\%) and some β-strand (∼7\%) and that ligand binding induces little change in secondary structure. {HBD} dimer dissociation, measured using size exclusion chromatography, exhibited a half-life of ∼1.2 h, which ligand binding increased ∼3-fold (estradiol) to ∼4-fold (4-hydroxytamoxifen). These results suggest that the isolated estrogen receptor {HBD} dimerizes and undergoes conformational changes associated with cooperative ligand binding in a manner comparable to the full-length protein, and that one effect of ligand binding is to alter the receptor dimer dissociation kinetics.},

Previous data had suggested that the positive cooperativity of the system was dependent upon a monomer-dimer equilibrium (Notides et al., Proc. natn. Acad. Sci., U.S.A. 78 (1981) 4926-4930). Using computer modeling, we confirmed that the thermodynamic constraints of a monomer-dimer equilibrium system result in convex Scatchard plots in agreement with experimental data, including the progression to linearity at low receptor concentrations. This technique yielded estimates of the equilibrium constant for dimerization (approx. 10(10) to 10(14) M-1). The dose-response characteristics of the monomer-dimer equilibrium system revealed steep dose-response curves that were sensitive to the receptor concentration. In contrast, the dose-response curves that did not undergo a monomer-dimer equilibrium system and had a single step equilibrium process were more gradual.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear Scatchard plots are often found for agonist binding to G-protein-coupled receptors. Because there is clear evidence of receptor dimerization, these nonlinear Scatchard plots can reflect cooperativity on agonist binding to the two binding sites in the dimer. According to this, the “two-state dimer receptor model” has been recently derived. In this article, the performance of the model has been analyzed in fitting data of agonist binding to A1 adenosine receptors, which are an example of receptor displaying concave downward Scatchard plots. Analysis of agonist/antagonist competition data for dopamine D1 receptors using the two-state dimer receptor model has also been performed. Although fitting to the two-state dimer receptor model was similar to the fitting to the “two-independent-site receptor model”, the former is simpler, and a discrimination test selects the two-state dimer receptor model as the best. This model was also very robust in fitting data of estrogen binding to the estrogen receptor, for which Scatchard plots are concave upward. On the one hand, the model would predict the already demonstrated existence of estrogen receptor dimers. On the other hand, the model would predict that concave upward Scatchard plots reflect positive cooperativity, which can be neither predicted nor explained by assuming the existence of two different affinity states. In summary, the two-state dimer receptor model is good for fitting data of binding to dimeric receptors displaying either linear, concave upward, or concave downward Scatchard plots},

	abstract = {Glucocorticoid receptor ({GR}) levels vary between tissues and individuals and are altered by physiological and pharmacological effectors. However, the effects and implications of differences in {GR} concentration have not been fully elucidated. Using three statistically different {GR} concentrations in transiently transfected {COS}-1 cells, we demonstrate, using co-immunoprecipitation ({CoIP}) and fluorescent resonance energy transfer ({FRET}), that high levels of wild type {GR} ({wtGR}), but not of dimerization deficient {GR} ({GRdim}), display ligand-independent dimerization. Whole-cell saturation ligand-binding experiments furthermore establish that positive cooperative ligand-binding, with a concomitant increased ligand-binding affinity, is facilitated by ligand-independent dimerization at high concentrations of {wtGR}, but not {GRdim}. The down-stream consequences of ligand-independent dimerization at high concentrations of {wtGR}, but not {GRdim}, are shown to include basal priming of the system as witnessed by ligand-independent transactivation of both a {GRE}-containing promoter-reporter and the endogenous glucocorticoid ({GC})-responsive gene, {GILZ}, as well as ligand-independent loading of {GR} onto the {GILZ} promoter. Pursuant to the basal priming of the system, addition of ligand results in a significantly greater modulation of transactivation potency than would be expected solely from the increase in ligand-binding affinity. Thus ligand-independent dimerization of the {GR} at high concentrations primes the system, through ligand-independent {DNA} loading and transactivation, which together with positive cooperative ligand-binding increases the potency of {GR} agonists and shifts the bio-character of partial {GR} agonists. Clearly {GR}-levels are a major factor in determining the sensitivity to {GCs} and a critical factor regulating transcriptional programs.},

	abstract = {Almost all existing models that explain heptahelical G-protein-coupled receptor ({GPCR}) operation are based on the occurrence of monomeric receptor species. However, an increasing number of studies show that many G-protein-coupled heptahelical membrane receptors ({HMR}) are expressed in the plasma membrane as dimers. We here review the approaches for fitting ligand binding data that are based on the existence of receptor monomers and also the new ones based on the existence of receptor dimers. The reasons for equivocal interpretations of the fitting of data to receptor dimers, assuming they are monomers, are also discussed. A recently devised model for receptor dimers provides a new approach for fitting data that eventually gives more accurate and physiological relevant parameters. Fitting data using the new procedure gives not only the equilibrium dissociation constants for high- and low-affinity binding to receptor dimers but also a “cooperativity index” that reflects the molecular communication within the dimer. A comprehensive way to fit binding data from saturation isotherms and from competition assays to a dimer receptor model is reported and compared with the traditional way of fitting data. The new procedure can be applied to any receptor forming dimers; from receptor tyrosine kinases to intracellular receptors (e.g., estrogen receptor) and in general for ligand binding to proteins forming dimers.},

We have developed receptors that are chemically labeled with a single fluorophore in a site-specific manner. These fluorophore-labeled {ERs} are functional and can be used to measure directly the affinity and stability of {ERalpha}-{LBD} dimers. Our results indicate that unliganded {ERalpha}-{LBDs} exist as very stable dimers and that the dissociation rate of these dimers is slow (t(1/2)=39 +/- 3 min at 28 C) and is further slowed ({\textless} or =7-fold) by the addition of various ligands. Estrogen antagonists provide greater kinetic stabilization of the {ER} dimers than agonists.

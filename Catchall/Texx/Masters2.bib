At 37 degrees C, the cell-bound 125I-{hEGF} initially may be recovered in a native form by acid extraction; upon subsequent incubation, the cell-bound 125I-{hEGF} is degraded very rapidly, with the appearance in the medium of 125I-monoiodotyrosine. At 0 degrees C, cell-bound 125I-{hEGF} is not degraded but slowly dissociates from the cell. The data are consistent with a mechanism in which 125I-{hEGF} initially is bound to the cell surface and subsequently is internlized before degradation. The degradation is blocked by inhibitors of metabolic energy production (azide, cyanide, dinitrophenol), some protease inhibitors (Tos-Lys-{CH}2Cl, benzyl guanidobenzoate), a lysosomotropic agent (chloroquine) various local anesthetics (cocaine, lidocaine, procaine), and ammonium chloride. After the binding and degradation of 125I-{hEGF} the fibroblasts are no longer able to rebind fresh hormone. The binding capacity of these cells is restored by incubation in a serum-containing medium; this restoration is inhibited by cycloheximide or actinomycin D.},

	abstract = {Protein kinases play a predominant regulatory role in nearly every aspect of cell biology and they can modify the function of a protein in almost every conceivable way. Protein phosphorylation can increase or decrease enzyme activity and it can alter other biological activities such as transcription and translation. Moreover, some phosphorylation sites on a given protein are stimulatory while others are inhibitory. The human protein kinase gene family consists of 518 members along with 106 pseudogenes. Furthermore, about 50 of the 518 gene products lack important catalytic residues and are called protein pseudokinases. The non-catalytic allosteric interaction of protein kinases and pseudokinases with other proteins has added an important regulatory feature to the biochemistry and cell biology of the protein kinase superfamily. With rare exceptions, a divalent cation such as Mg(2+) is required for the reaction. All protein kinases exist in a basal state and are activated only as necessary by divergent regulatory stimuli. The mechanisms for switching between dormant and active protein kinases can be intricate. Phosphorylase kinase was the first protein kinase to be characterized biochemically and the mechanism of its regulation led to the discovery of {cAMP}-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A, or {PKA}), which catalyzes the phosphorylation and activation of phosphorylase kinase. This was the first protein kinase cascade or signaling module to be elucidated. The epidermal growth factor receptor-Ras-Raf-{MEK}-{ERK} signaling module contains protein-tyrosine, protein-serine/threonine, and dual specificity protein kinases. {PKA} has served as a prototype of this enzyme family and more is known about this enzyme than any other protein kinase. The inactive {PKA} holoenzyme consists of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. After binding four molecules of {cAMP}, the holoenzyme dissociates into a regulatory subunit dimer (each monomer binds two {cAMP}) and two free and active catalytic subunits. {PKA} and all other protein kinase domains have a small amino-terminal lobe and large carboxyterminal lobe as determined by X-ray crystallography. The N-lobe and C-lobe form a cleft that serves as a docking site for {MgATP}. Nearly all active protein kinases contain a K/E/D/D signature sequence that plays important structural and catalytic roles. Protein kinases contain hydrophobic catalytic and regulatory spines and collateral shell residues that are required to assemble the active enzyme. There are two general kinds of conformational changes associated with most protein kinases. The first conformational change involves the formation of an intact regulatory spine to form an active enzyme. The second conformational change occurs in active kinases as they toggle between open and closed conformations during their catalytic cycles. Because mutations and dysregulation of protein kinases play causal roles in human disease, this family of enzymes has become one of the most important drug targets over the past two decades. Imatinib was approved by the United States {FDA} for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia in 2001; this small molecule inhibits the {BCR}-Abl protein kinase oncoprotein that results from the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome. More than two dozen other orally effective mechanism-based small molecule protein kinase inhibitors have been subsequently approved by the {FDA}. These drugs bind to the {ATP}-binding site of their target enzymes and extend into nearby hydrophobic pockets. Most of these protein kinase inhibitors prolong survival in cancer patients only weeks or months longer than standard cytotoxic therapies. In contrast, the clinical effectiveness of imatinib against chronic myelogenous leukemia is vastly superior to that of any other targeted protein kinase inhibitor with overall survival lasting a decade or more. However, the near universal and expected development of drug resistance in the treatment of neoplastic disorders requires new approaches to solve this therapeutic challenge. Cancer is the predominant indication for these drugs, but disease targets are increasing. For example, we can expect the approval of new drugs inhibiting other protein kinases in the treatment of illnesses such as hypertension, Parkinson's disease, and autoimmune diseases.},

Little, however, is known about the precise molecular details of ligand-induced receptor dimerization, except for studies of the human growth hormone ({hGH}) receptor. We have analyzed the binding of epidermal growth factor ({EGF}) to the extracellular domain of its receptor ({sEGFR}) using titration calorimetry, and the resulting dimerization of {sEGFR} using small-angle X-ray scattering. {EGF} induces the quantitative formation of {sEGFR} dimers that contain two {EGF} molecules. The data obtained from the two approaches suggest a model in which one {EGF} monomer binds to one {sEGFR} monomer, and that receptor dimerization involves subsequent association of two monomeric (1:1) {EGF}-{sEGFR} complexes. Dimerization may result from bivalent binding of both {EGF} molecules in the dimer and/or receptor-receptor interactions. The requirement for two (possibly bivalent) {EGF} monomers distinguishes {EGF}-induced {sEGFR} dimerization from the {hGH} and interferon-gamma receptors, where multivalent binding of a single ligand species (either monomeric or dimeric) drives receptor oligomerization. The proposed model of {EGF}-induced {sEGFR} dimerization suggests possible mechanisms for both ligand-induced homo- and heterodimerization of the {EGFR} (or {erbB}) family of receptors.},

Herein, our team has designed and synthesized new eighteen compounds with 6-substituted 4-anilinoquinazoline core to selectively inhibit {EGFR}/{HER}2 tyrosine kinases. Twelve compounds (8a-8d, 9a, 9c, 9d, 10a, 10c, 11b, 14, and 15) showed nanomolar range of {IC}50 values on {EGFR} and/or {HER}2 kinases.

A molecular docking study demonstrated the favorable binding modes of 8d, 9b, 9d and 10d at the {ATP} active site of both kinases. A kinase selectivity profile performed for compound 8d showed great selectivity for {EGFR} and {HER}2. In addition, 8d, 9c, and 9d exerted selective promising cytotoxic activity over {BT}-474 cell line with {IC}50 values of 2.70, 1.82 and 1.95{μM}, respectively.

Deletion of 63 amino acids from the C-terminal end of {EGF}-receptor, which removes two autophosphorylation sites, abolishes the high affinity state of the receptor. Nevertheless, this receptor mutant is able to undergo endocytosis and to respond mitogenically to {EGF} to a similar extent as the "wild type" receptor. Further deletions from the cytoplasmic domain give rise to low affinity endocytosis-defective receptor mutants. Finally, deletion of the transmembrane domain of the human receptor yields an {EGF}-receptor ligand binding domain which is secreted from the cells.},

In this activated complex the intracellular kinase domains associate to form an asymmetric dimer that supports the allosteric activation of one kinase. These models are discussed with emphasis on recent studies that add details or bolster the generality of this view of activation of this family of receptors. The {EGFR} family is implicated in several disease states, perhaps most notably in cancers. Activating tumor mutations have been identified in the intracellular and extracellular regions of {EGFR}.

We have studied the influence of {EGF} on malignant human breast tissue with a model system comprising human breast carcinoma cells growing in tissue culture. {EGF} stimulated growth of {MCF}-7 cells in serum-free medium. After 7 days in culture, a 2-fold increase in cell number and {DNA} content and a 3-fold increase in total protein were observed in cells incubated with {EGF} (10 ng/ml). As little as 0.01 ng/ml of {EGF} stimulated growth; 10 ng/ml was maximal. {EGF} effects on growth were noted for cells plated at a high as well as sparse (cloning) density. {EGF} also stimulated the rates of thymidine, uridine, and leucine incorporation into macromolecules in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Stimulation of uridine and leucine incorporation was evident by 3 hr, whereas {EGF} stimulation of thymidine incorporation was delayed until 12 to 18 hr. {EGF} increased the proportion of cells active in {DNA} synthesis by nearly 2-fold. The combination of optimal concentrations of insulin (also a growth factor for these cells) and {EGF} did not stimulate growth above that seen with either hormone alone, suggesting a common step in their mechanism of action. The {EGF} effect was not dependent on the presence of serum and was not enhanced by dexamethasone as reported for other types of cells. {EGF} had no effect on another human breast cancer cell line, the {MDA}-231. These studies suggest that growth of some human breast cancers may be influenced by {EGF}.},

	abstract = {This chapter reviews the understanding of the mechanisms by which small molecules bind to macromolecules is important to many fields of biomedical research. The study of ligand-binding problems usually involves the collection of a set of data reflecting the quantity of ligand bound as a function of ligand and possibly macromolecular concentration. The binding constants are then determined by least-squares fitting an assumed equation to these data. The quality of the fit of the assumed equation is then used to test if the assumed functional form of the equation is consistent with the experimental data. If the fit does not provide a good description of the experimental data then either the function form is wrong, the fitting procedure was in error, or the data contained systematic errors. The chapter presents a simple statistical thermodynamic approach to the derivation of equations to describe ligand-binding experiments. The advantage of this approach is that it can be used to translate virtually any conceptual mechanistic model into a mathematical formula. The statistical thermodynamic approach requires the investigator to define the conceptual model in terms of states and rules. The states are simply all the microscopic configurations in which the macromolecule can exist. The rules are simply statements of the free energy levels corresponding to each accessible state of the macromolecule.},

	abstract = {Protein kinase A ({PKA}) holoenzyme consists of two catalytic (C) subunits and a regulatory (R) subunit dimer (R2C2). The kinase is activated by the binding of {cAMPs} to the two cyclic nucleotide binding domains ({CBDs}), A and B, on each R-subunit. Despite extensive study, details of the allosteric mechanisms underlying the cooperativity of holoenzyme activation remain unclear. Several Markov state models of {PKA}-{RIα} were developed to test competing theories of activation for the R2C2 complex. We found that {CBD}-B plays an essential role in R-C interaction and promotes the release of the first C-subunit prior to the binding to {CBD}-A. This favors a conformational selection mechanism for release of the first C-subunit of {PKA}. However, the release of the second C-subunit requires all four {cAMP} sites to be occupied. These analyses elucidate R-C heterodimer interactions in the cooperative activation of {PKA} and {cAMP} binding and represent a new mechanistic model of R2C2 {PKA}-{RIα} activation.},

As patients may acquire resistance-mediating mutations within the extracellular {EGFR} domain, functional dissection of the exact binding sites of {EGFR} targeting antibodies may help predict treatment responses. We therefore assessed the epitope recognition of panitumumab by screening phage-displayed random cyclic 7mer and linear 12mer peptide libraries on this antibody. Phage screenings revealed two strong, potentially epitope-mimicking consensus motifs targeted by panitumumab. A computational approach was used to map the sequences back to the potential epitope region on domain {III} of {EGFR}. The presumed epitope regions (386){WPEXRT}(391) and a biochemically similar though discontinuous region P349-F352-D355 on a neighboring loop of domain {III} could be confirmed as part of the functionally relevant binding site of panitumumab by site-directed mutational analysis. To more accurately differentiate the panitumumab epitope from the previously characterized cetuximab epitope, binding studies were performed on a broad range of additional mutants. Taken together, this analysis revealed two large, partially overlapping functional epitopes consisting of 17 critical amino acid positions. Four of these positions were selectively targeted by cetuximab (I467, S468, Q408, and H409), whereas another four were selectively recognized by panitumumab (W386, E388, R390, and T391). In view of the clinical significance of extracellular domain mutations, our data may help guide treatment decisions in selected patients receiving {EGFR}-targeted therapies.},

	abstract = {The epidermal growth factor receptor has received much interest as a target for various antineoplastic agents, but a complication is that many normal tissues also express this receptor. We have previously identified in human glial tumors an 801-bp in-frame deletion within the epidermal growth factor receptor gene that created a novel epitope at the junction. By using Western blot assays with a mutant-specific antibody as a rapid and sensitive means for detecting this alteration in primary human tumors, it was found that 57\% (26 of 46) of high-grade and 86\% (6 of 7) of low-grade glial tumors, but not normal brain, express this protein. This altered receptor was also present in 66\% (4 of 6) of pediatric gliomas and 86\% (6 of 7) of medulloblastomas, 78\% (21 of 27) of breast carcinomas, and 73\% (24 of 32) of ovarian carcinomas. The fact that this receptor is frequently found in tumors but not in normal tissue makes it an attractive candidate for various antitumor strategies.},

As a result, {EGFR} and its relatives have frequently been termed “prototypical” {RTKs}. Many years of mechanistic studies, however, have revealed that—far from being prototypical—the {EGFR} family is quite unique. As we discuss in this review, the {EGFR} family uses a distinctive “receptor-mediated” dimerization mechanism, with ligand binding inducing a dramatic conformational change that exposes a dimerization arm. Intracellular kinase domain regulation in this family is also unique, being driven by allosteric changes induced by asymmetric dimer formation rather than the more typical activation-loop phosphorylation. {EGFR} family members also distinguish themselves from other {RTKs} in having an intracellular juxtamembrane ({JM}) domain that activates (rather than autoinhibits) the receptor and a very large carboxy-terminal tail that contains autophosphorylation sites and serves an autoregulatory function. We discuss recent advances in mechanistic aspects of all of these components of {EGFR} family members, attempting to integrate them into a view of how {RTKs} in this important class are regulated at the cell surface.},

In my opinion, experimental progress is hampered by a commonly used but misleading definition of allostery as protein structural changes that are elicited by the binding of a single ligand. Allostery is more strictly defined in functional terms as a comparison of how one ligand binds in the absence, versus the presence, of a second ligand. Therefore, as each of the two binding events involves two protein complexes, a study of allostery must consider four complexes and not just two. Such a comparison can distinguish allosteric from non-allosteric protein changes, the importance of which is frequently overlooked. When a study of all four complexes is not feasible, an alternative, albeit limited, strategy can identify subsets of allosteric-specific changes.},

Such “specific” nonreceptor interactions, which can potentially complicate interpretations of receptor binding studies, also exhibit characteristics analogous to those observed in liver membranes where the data have been interpreted (3) to indicate “negative cooperativity” between receptors. Similar data are presented here for insulin and epidermal growth factor binding to placenta membranes, and the effects of porcine insulin are compared to those of guinea pig insulin, a derivative which dimerizes very poorly. The “negative cooperativity” observed in the nonreceptor systems is most likely attributable to insulin-insulin interactions. Wherever ligand (e.g., hormone) self-association or isomerization occurs, the binding data (e.g. Scatchard plot) may yield nonlinear relationships which can falsely be interpreted as indicating cooperative interactions between receptors, or the presence of “additional groups” of binding sites.},

	abstract = {The {EGF} receptor has seven different cognate ligands. Previous work has shown that these different ligands are capable of inducing different biological effects, even in the same cell. To begin to understand the molecular basis for this variation, we used luciferase fragment complementation to measure ligand-induced dimer formation and radioligand binding to study the effect of the ligands on subunit-subunit interactions in {EGF} receptor ({EGFR}) homodimers and {EGFR}/{ErbB}2 heterodimers. In luciferase fragment complementation imaging studies, amphiregulin ({AREG}) functioned as a partial agonist, inducing only about half as much total dimerization as the other three ligands. However, unlike the other ligands, {AREG} showed biphasic kinetics for dimer formation, suggesting that its path for {EGF} receptor activation involves binding to both monomers and preformed dimers. {EGF}, {TGFα}, and betacellulin ({BTC}) appear to mainly stimulate receptor activation through binding to and dimerization of receptor monomers. In radioligand binding assays, {EGF} and {TGFα} exhibited increased affinity for {EGFR}/{ErbB}2 heterodimers compared with {EGFR} homodimers. By contrast, {BTC} and {AREG} showed a similar affinity for both dimers. Thus, {EGF} and {TGFα} are biased agonists, whereas {BTC} and {AREG} are balanced agonists with respect to selectivity of dimer formation. These data suggest that the differences in biological response to different {EGF} receptor ligands may result from partial agonism for dimer formation, differences in the kinetic pathway utilized to generate activated receptor dimers, and biases in the formation of heterodimers versus homodimers.},

	abstract = {The binding of many polypeptide hormones to cell surface receptors does not appear to follow the law of mass action. While steady–state binding data are consistent in many cases with either heterogeneous populations of binding sites or interactions of the type known as negative cooperativity, study of the kinetics of dissociation of the hormone receptor complex allows an unambiguous demonstration of cooperative interactions. Negative cooperativity, which seems to be wide-spread among hormone receptors, provides exquisite sensitivity of the cell at low hormone concentrations while buffering against acutely elevated hormone levels. The molecular mechanisms underlying the cooperativity are still largely unknown. Cooperativity may stem from a conformational transition in individual receptors or involve receptor aggregation in the fluid membrane (clustering) or more extensive membrane phenomena. Thus, new models of hormone action must be considered which integrate the progress in our knowledge of both the complex mechanisms regulating hormone binding to their surface receptors, and the dynamic properties of the cell membrane.},

However, evidence of these structural dynamics in intact cells has been lacking. Here we use luciferase complementation imaging to follow {EGF}-induced conformational changes in its receptor in real time in live cells. When the luciferase fragments are fused to the C terminus of an {EGF} receptor lacking the cytoplasmic domain, {EGF} stimulates a rapid increase in luciferase activity, consistent with ligand-induced receptor dimerization. However, when the luciferase fragments are fused to the C terminus of the full-length receptor, {EGF} induces a rapid but transient decrease in luciferase activity. The decrease requires tyrosine kinase activity, whereas the subsequent recovery requires {MAP} kinase activity. Our data demonstrate the utility of the luciferase system for in vivo imaging changes in {EGF} receptor dimerization and conformation. They also identify two sequential ligand-induced conformational changes in the {EGF} receptor.},

This was typically interpreted as being due to the presence of two independent binding site–one of high affinity representing ≤10\% of the receptor population and one of low affinity making up the bulk of the receptors. However, the concept of two independent binding sites is difficult to reconcile with the X-ray structures of the dimerized {EGF} receptor that show symmetric binding of the two ligands. A new approach to the analysis of 125I-{EGF} binding data combined with the structure of the singly-occupied Drosophila {EGF} receptor have now shown that this heterogeneity is due to the presence of negative cooperativity in the {EGF} receptor. Concerns that negative cooperativity precludes ligand-induced dimerization of the {EGF} receptor confuse the concepts of linkage cooperativity. Linkage refers to the effect of ligand on the assembly of dimers while cooperativity refers to the effect of ligand binding to one subunit on ligand binding to the other subunit within a preassembled dimer. Binding of {EGF} to its receptor is positively linked with dimer assembly but shows negative cooperativity within the dimer.},

	abstract = {Hexavalent chromium (Cr({VI})) compounds are well-established lung carcinogens. Epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) is a tyrosine kinase transmembrane receptor that regulates cell survival, tumor invasion, and angiogenesis. Our results show that chronic exposure of human bronchial epithelial ({BEAS}-2B) cells to Cr({VI}) is able to cause malignant cell transformation. These transformed cells exhibit apoptosis resistance with reduced poly {ADP}-ribose polymerase cleavage (C-{PARP}) and Bax expression and enhanced expressions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-{xL}. These transformed cells also exhibit reduced capacity of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) generation along with elevated expression of antioxidant manganese superoxide dismutase 2 ({SOD}2). The expression of this antioxidant was also elevated in lung tumor tissue from a worker exposed to Cr({VI}) for 19 years. {EGFR} was activated in Cr({VI})-transformed {BEAS}-2B cells, lung tissue from animals exposed to Cr({VI}) particles, and human lung tumor tissue. Further study indicates that constitutive activation of {EGFR} in Cr({VI})-transformed cells was due to increased binding to its ligand amphiregulin ({AREG}). Inhibition of {EGFR} or {AREG} increased Bax expression and reduced Bcl-2 expression, resulting in reduced apoptosis resistance. Furthermore, inhibition of {AREG} or {EGFR} restored capacity of {ROS} generation and decreased {SOD}2 expression. {PI}3K/{AKT} was activated, which depended on {EGFR} in Cr({VI})-transformed {BEAS}-2B cells. Inhibition of {PI}3K/{AKT} increased {ROS} generation and reduced {SOD}2 expression, resulting in reduced apoptosis resistance with commitment increase in Bax expression and reduction of Bcl-2 expression. Xenograft mouse tumor study further demonstrates the essential role of {EGFR} in tumorigenesis of Cr({VI})-transformed cells. In summary, the present study suggests that ligand-dependent constitutive activation of {EGFR} causes reduced {ROS} generation and increased antioxidant expression, leading to development of apoptosis resistance, contributing to Cr({VI})-induced tumorigenesis.},

We have attempted to derive a mathematical model for {EGF} binding to the {EGFR} and for ligand-induced receptor dimerization and activation that uses this structural information and can explain the characteristic concave-up curvilinear Scatchard plots seen when {EGF} binding to intact {EGFR} is studied in living cells. We show that these curvilinear plots cannot be accounted for by simply ascribing different affinities to the autoinhibited and extended (dimeric) configurations of the receptor seen in structural studies. Concave-up plots can only be obtained by including in the mathematical model an additional binding event in which occupied {EGFR} dimers bind to an “external site.” The external site may represent receptor interactions with coated-pit regions in the cell membrane or with other cellular components involved in receptor endocytosis and turnover. We conclude in this study and in the accompanying article that the active extended {EGFR} configuration binds {EGF} 5- to 20-fold more strongly than the autoinhibited monomeric receptor configuration. However, these extended receptors do not correspond directly with the “high-affinity” {EGF}-binding sites seen in {EGF}-binding studies on intact cells.},

	abstract = {We have prepared a conjugate of epidermal growth factor ({EGF}) and ferritin that retains substantial binding affinity for cell receptors and is biologically active. Glutaraldehyde-activated {EGF} was covalently linked to ferritin to produce a conjugate that contained {EGF} and ferritin in a 1:1 molar ratio. The conjugate was separated from free ferritin by affinity chromatography using antibodies to {EGF}. Monolayers of human epithelioid carcinoma cells (A-431) were incubated with {EGF}:ferritin at 4 degrees C and processed for transmission electron microscopy. Under these conditions, approximately 6 X 10(5) molecules of {EGF}:ferritin bound to the plasma membrane of each cell. In the presence of excess native {EGF}, the number of bound ferritin particles was reduced by 99\%, indicating that {EGF}:ferritin binds specifically to cellular {EGF} receptors. At 37 degrees C, cell-bound {EGF}:ferritin rapidly redistributed in the plane of the plasma membrane to form small groups that were subsequently internalized into pinocytic vesicles. By 2.5 min at 37 degrees C, 32\% of the cell-bound {EGF}:ferritin was localized in vesicles. After 2.5 min, there was a decrease in the proportion of conjugate in vesicles with a concomitant accumulation of {EGF}:ferritin in multivesicular bodies. By 30 min, 84\% of the conjugate was located in structures morphologically identified as multivesicular bodies or lysosomes. These results are consistent with other morphological and biochemical studies utilizing 125I-{EGF} and fluorescein-conjugated {EGF}.},

We have used two types of fluorescent analogues of insulin and epidermal growth factor: highly fluorescent derivatives which have seven to eight rhodamine molecules or fluorescent derivatives which have a single rhodamine molecule per one molecule of insulin or epidermal growth factor. Both types of analogue retained substantial binding affinity as determined by radioreceptor assays and biological activity. The cells labeled with the fluorescent analogues were visualized with a sensitive video intensification microscopic system that enabled us to directly observe the location of the fluorescent hormone on the surface and within the living fibroblasts. We found that both insulin and epidermal growth factor initially bound diffusely to the cell surface and, at 4°, remained dispersed. Within a few minutes at 23° or 37° the hormone-receptor complexes aggregated into patches that could be readily removed by trypsin but not by excess native hormone. The hormone-receptor complexes, which were initially mobile in the plane of the membrane, become immobilized later as the consequence of the receptor aggregation or internalization. Within ∼30 min at 37°, much of the labeled hormone was found within the cell in endocytic vesicles that moved about in the cytoplasm in a saltatory manner. The aggregation and immobilization of the hormone-receptor complexes could be due to either hormone-hormone interactions on the cell membrane or a hormone-induced conformational change in the hormone-receptor complex. Aggregation and internalization of hormone-receptor complexes could be associated with certain aspects of hormone action, hormone degradation, down regulation of receptors, or negative cooperativity of hormone binding.},

Here, we used a super resolution imaging technique, which has shattered the longstanding resolution barrier of light diffraction, to investigate the distribution of membrane {EGFR} on apical or basal surfaces of {COS}-7 cells and on the surface of suspended {COS}-7 cells. Our data show that more and larger {EGFR} clusters are detected on the apical surface in comparison with those on the basal surface and this difference is not affected by the {EGFR} activation state, whereas suspended {COS}-7 cells exhibit a moderate clustering state and a homogeneous distribution pattern, indicating that the external environment surrounding the cell membrane is the decisive factor in the {EGFR} clustering pattern. A dual-color {dSTORM} image reveals the significant colocalization of {EGFR} and lipid rafts; interestingly {MβCD} treatment leads to a dramatic decrease of the amount and size of {EGFR} clusters on both apical and basal surfaces, highlighting a key role of lipid rafts in {EGFR} cluster formation. Altogether, our results illustrate the distribution pattern of {EGFR} in polarized cells and uncover the essential role of lipid rafts in {EGFR} cluster maintenance.},

	abstract = {The {EGF} receptor is a classical receptor-tyrosine kinase. In the absence of ligand, the receptor adopts a closed conformation in which the dimerization arm of subdomain {II} interacts with the tethering arm in subdomain {IV}. Following the binding of {EGF}, the receptor opens to form a symmetric, back-to-back dimer. Although it is clear that the dimerization arm of subdomain {II} is central to the formation of receptor dimers, the role of the tethering arm of subdomain {IV} (residues 561-585) in this configuration is not known. Here we use (125)I-{EGF} binding studies to assess the functional role of the tethering arm in the {EGF} receptor dimer. Mutation of the three major residues that contribute to tethering (D563A,H566A,K585A-{EGF} receptor) did not significantly alter either the ligand binding properties or the signaling properties of the {EGF} receptor. By contrast, breaking the Cys(558)-Cys(567) disulfide bond through double alanine replacements or deleting the loop entirely led to a decrease in the negative cooperativity in {EGF} binding and was associated with small changes in downstream signaling. Deletion of the Cys(571)-Cys(593) disulfide bond abrogated cooperativity, resulting in a high affinity receptor and increased sensitivity of downstream signaling pathways to {EGF}. Releasing the Cys(571)-Cys(593) disulfide bond resulted in extreme negative cooperativity, ligand-independent kinase activity, and impaired downstream signaling. These data demonstrate that the tethering arm plays an important role in supporting cooperativity in ligand binding. Because cooperativity implies subunit-subunit interactions, these results also suggest that the tethering arm contributes to intersubunit interactions within the {EGF} receptor dimer.},

The results indicate how {EGFR} family members can bind a family of highly variable ligands. In the 2:2 {TGFα}:{sEGFR}501 complex, each ligand interacts with only one receptor molecule.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Chlorine dioxide ({ClO}2) is an oxidizing agent with known bactericidal, viricidal and fungicidal properties. Its efficacy in reducing the halitosis has been established by previous literature. However, data evaluating its antiplaque property is scarce. Chlorhexidine ({CHX}) is considered as the gold standard and an effective adjunctive to mechanical plaque removal. However, it is associated with few reversible side effects. Therefore a study was conducted to assess the antiplaque property of {ClO}2 containing mouthrinse against {CHX} mouthrinse.
{AIMS} {AND} {OBJECTIVES}: To evaluate the efficacy of stabilized chlorine dioxide containing mouthrinse and {CHX} containing mouthrinse in inhibition of tongue coat accumulation and dental plaque formation using a four day plaque regrowth model clinically and microbiologically in a healthy dental cohort.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: A Single Center, Randomized, Triple blinded, Microbiological clinical trial was conducted involving 25 healthy dental students volunteers (11 males, 14 females). Two commercially available mouthrinse: Mouthrinse A - Aqueous based {ClO}2 mouthrinse Freshchlor(®) and Mouthrinse B - Aqueous based 0.2\% {CHX} mouthrinse Hexidine(®) were selected as the test products. Subjects were asked to rinse and gargle for 1 minute with the allocated mouthrinse under supervision after supragingival scaling, polishing and tongue coat removal. After four hours, smears were taken from the buccal mucosa and tooth surface. On the fifth day from baseline of four day non brushing plaque regrowth model the samples were again taken from buccal mucosa and tooth surface followed by recording of plaque scores by Rastogi Modification of Navy Plaque index, extent of tongue coat by Winkel's tongue coating index and measuring tongue coat wet weight in grams. The samples collected were subjected to microbial analysis and the results were expressed as colony forming units ({CFUs}) per sample.
{STATISTICAL} {ANALYSIS}: The Data was analysed using {SPSS} 16.00 and presented using descriptive statistics. Independent t-test was used for the comparison between mouthrinse A groups \& mouthrinse B group.
{RESULTS}: The plaque scores and Winkels tongue coat scores, wet tongue coat weight recorded on the fifth day after the use of the two mouthrinse didn't show a statistically significant difference. The {CFU} per sample from tooth and mucosa after four hours revealed low bacteria count with respect to mouthrinse B however the {CFU} obtained on the fifth day did not show a statistically significant difference between the two mouthrinse.
{CONCLUSION}: The clinical antiplaque efficacy of {CHX} and {ClO}2 mouthwash is comparable and so is the efficacy in reducing the oral bacterial load.},

There was a significant (p less than 0.01) correlation between the presence of the growth factor receptor and poor prognosis as assessed by the Bloom and Richardson score, suggesting that epidermal growth factor receptor state could be a useful prognostic marker.

L., and Pike, L. J. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 105, 112–117). However, despite the fact that biochemical analyses indicate that {EGF} induces dimerization of its receptor, the binding data provided no evidence for positive linkage between {EGF} binding and dimer assembly. By analyzing the binding of {EGF} to a number of receptor mutants, we now report that in naive, unphosphorylated {EGF} receptors, ligand binding is positively linked to receptor dimerization but the linkage is abolished upon autophosphorylation of the receptor. Both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated {EGF} receptors exhibit negative cooperativity, indicating that mechanistically, cooperativity is distinct from the phenomenon of linkage. Nonetheless, both the positive linkage and the negative cooperativity observed in {EGF} binding require the presence of the intracellular juxtamembrane domain. This indicates the existence of inside-out signaling in the {EGF} receptor system. The intracellular juxtamembrane domain has previously been shown to be required for the activation of the {EGF} receptor tyrosine kinase (Thiel, K. W., and Carpenter, G. (2007) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 104, 19238–19243). Our experiments expand the role of this domain to include the allosteric control of ligand binding by the extracellular domain.},

	abstract = {Epidermal growth factor ({EGF}) at 3 {nM} maximally inhibits the proliferation of A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells. We show that at lower concentrations, in the range of 3-100 {pM}, {EGF} has a mitogenic effect on A431 cells. In the presence of 100 {nM} anti-{EGF}-receptor monoclonal {IgG} (designated 528), which inhibits A431 cell proliferation and blocks greater than 95\% of {EGF} binding, {EGF} becomes mitogenic for A431 cells at concentrations up to 3 {nM}. These results suggest that a minor population of high-affinity {EGF} receptors may be involved in stimulation of A431 cell proliferation. Saturation binding assays with 125I-labeled {EGF} indicate that approximately equal to 0.1-0.2\% of receptors for {EGF} are high-affinity receptors that bind {EGF} with an estimated Kd of 7 X 10(-11) M. This affinity is nearly 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the remaining {EGF} receptors. Although A431 cell proliferation is maximally inhibited by nonsaturating amounts of {EGF} (3 {nM}), maximal inhibition by 528 {IgG} (approximately equal to 70\% of maximal inhibition by {EGF}) requires saturating concentrations of antibody (approximately equal to 15 {nM}). Unlike {EGF}, rapid down-regulation is not observed with 528 {IgG}. These results indicate different mechanisms of growth inhibition of A431 cells by {EGF} and 528 {IgG}.},

Frequently, the active ligand must be released from the membrane by proteolysis before signaling can occur. Here, we discuss {RTK} ligand shedding and describe the proteases that catalyze it in flies and mammals. We focus principally on the control of {EGF} receptor ligand shedding, but also refer to ligands of other {RTKs}. Two prominent themes emerge. First, control by regulated trafficking and cellular compartmentalization of the proteases and their ligand substrates plays a key role in shedding. Second, many external signals converge on the shedding proteases and their control machinery. Proteases therefore act as regulatory hubs that integrate information that the cell receives and translate it into precise outgoing signals. The activation of signaling by proteases is therefore an essential element of the cellular communication machinery.},

Holo {EGF} receptor is activated by ligand binding to the extracellular domain to activate cytoplasmic tyrosine protein kinase activity. A model of single molecule transmembrane signaling is proposed. The function of two phosphorylation sites on the {EGF} receptor has been analyzed by use of site-directed mutagenesis. Comparison of normal and mutant {hEGF} receptors expressed in rodent cells lacking endogenous {EGF} receptors indicates that: (1) Thr654, located 10 amino acids carboxyl terminal to the inner membrane boundary, is a major site of heterologous regulation via protein kinase C catalyzed phosphorylation, and (2) Tyr1173, the major site of self-phosphorylation, located at the carboxyl terminus, provides a secondary level of regulation of receptor function by acting as a competitive inhibitor with exogenous substrates.},

	abstract = {The orphan receptor tyrosine kinase {ErbB}2 ({HER}2/Neu) transforms cells when overexpressed, and is an important therapeutic target in human cancer,. Structural studies, have suggested that the oncogenic (and ligand-independent) signalling properties of {ErbB}2 result from the absence of a key intramolecular ‘tether’ in the extracellular region that autoinhibits other human {ErbB} receptors, including the epidermal growth factor ({EGF}) receptor. Although {ErbB}2 is clearly unique among the four human {ErbB} receptors,, we show here that it is the closest structural relative of the single {EGF} receptor family member ({dEGFR}) in Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic and biochemical data show that {dEGFR} is tightly regulated by growth factor ligands, yet a crystal structure shows that it too lacks the intramolecular tether seen in human {EGFR}, {ErbB}3 and {ErbB}4. Instead, a distinct set of autoinhibitory interdomain interactions hold unliganded {dEGFR} in an inactive state. All of these interactions are maintained (and even extended) in {ErbB}2, arguing against the suggestion that {ErbB}2 lacks autoinhibition. We therefore suggest that normal and pathogenic {ErbB}2 signalling may be regulated by ligands in the same way as {dEGFR}. Our findings have important implications for {ErbB}2 regulation in human cancer, and for developing therapeutic approaches to target novel aspects of this orphan receptor.},

After ten years from the individuation of activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the {EGFR} in {NSCLC} patients responding to the {EGFR} tyrosine kinase inhibitor ({TKI}) Gefitinib, several progresses have been done and first line treatment with {EGFR} {TKIs} is a firmly established option in advanced {EGFR}-mutated {NSCLC} patients. During the last decade, different {EGFR} {TKIs} have been developed and three inhibitors have been approved so far in these selected patients. However, despite great breakthroughs have been made, treatment of these molecularly selected patients poses novel therapeutic challenges, such as emerging of acquired resistance, brain metastases development or the need to translate these treatments in earlier clinical settings, such as adjuvant therapy. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the major progresses reported so far in the {EGFR} inhibition in this molecularly-selected subgroup of {NSCLC} patients, from the early successes with first generation {EGFR} {TKIs}, Erlotinib and Gefitinib, to the novel irreversible and mutant-selective inhibitors and ultimately the emerging challenges that we, in the next future, are called to deal with.},

However, the oligomeric states of {EGFRs} induced by {EGF} binding and the receptor-ligand stoichiometry required for its activation are still controversial. In the present study, we performed Förster resonance energy transfer ({FRET}) measurements by combining the coiled-coil tag-probe labeling method and spectral imaging to quantitatively analyze {EGFR} oligomerization on living {CHO}-K1 cell membranes at physiological expression levels. In the absence of its ligands, {EGFRs} mainly existed as monomers with a small fraction of predimers ({\textasciitilde}10\%), whereas {\textasciitilde}70\% of the {EGFRs} formed dimers after being stimulated with the ligand {EGF}. Ligand-induced dimerization was not significantly affected by the perturbation of membrane components (cholesterol or monosialoganglioside {GM}3). We also investigated both dose- and time- dependences of {EGF}-dependent {EGFR} dimerization and autophosphorylation. The formation of dimers occurred within 20 s of the ligand stimulation and preceded its autophosphorylation, which reached a plateau 90 s after the stimulation. The {EGF} concentration needed to evoke half maximum dimerization ({\textasciitilde}1 {nM}) was lower than that for half-maximum autophosphorylation ({\textasciitilde}8 {nM}), which suggested the presence of an inactive dimer binding a single {EGF} molecule.},

In particular, a number of {EGFR} mutants that demonstrate ligand-independent signaling are common in non-small cell lung cancer ({NSCLC}), including kinase domain mutations L858R (also called L834R) and exon 19 deletions (e.g. ΔL747-P753insS) which collectively make up nearly 90\% of mutations in {NSCLC}. The molecular mechanisms by which these mutations confer constitutive activity remain unresolved. Using multiple subdiffraction-limit imaging modalities, we reveal the altered receptor structure and interaction kinetics of {NSCLC}-associated {EGFR} mutants. We applied two-color single quantum dot tracking to quantify receptor dimerization kinetics on living cells and show that, in contrast to wild type {EGFR}, mutants are capable of forming stable, ligand-independent dimers. Two-color super-resolution localization microscopy confirmed ligand-independent aggregation of {EGFR} mutants. Live cell {FRET} measurements revealed that the L858R kinase mutation alters ectodomain structure such that unliganded mutant {EGFR} adopts an extended, dimerization-competent conformation. Finally, mutation of the putative dimerization arm confirmed a critical role for ectodomain engagement in ligand-independent signaling. These data support a model in which dysregulated activity of {NSCLC}-associated kinase mutants is driven by coordinated interactions involving both the kinase and extracellular domains that lead to enhanced dimerization.},

Ligand binding may also trigger allosteric changes in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor that is crucial for signalling. Despite these insights, ensemble-averaging approaches have not determined the precise mechanism of receptor activation in situ. Using quantum-dot-based optical tracking of single molecules combined with a novel time-dependent diffusivity analysis, here we present the dimerization dynamics of individual {EGFRs} on living cells. Before ligand addition, {EGFRs} spontaneously formed finite-lifetime dimers kinetically stabilized by their dimerization arms. The dimers were primed both for ligand binding and for signalling, such that after {EGF} addition they rapidly showed a very slow diffusivity state that correlated with activation. Although the kinetic stability of unliganded dimers was in principle sufficient for {EGF}-independent activation, ligand binding was still required for signalling. Interestingly, dimers were enriched in the cell periphery in an actin- and receptor-expression-dependent fashion, resulting in a peripheral enhancement of {EGF}-induced signalling that may enable polarized responses to growth factors.},

	abstract = {The epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) is a promising target for anti-cancer therapy because of its role in tumour growth, metastasis and angiogenesis, and tumour resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This chapter describes a low-molecular- weight {EGFR} tyrosine kinase inhibitor ({EGFR}-{TKI}), Iressa (gefitinib, {ZD}1839). Iressa is a potent {EGFR}-{TKI} which blocks {EGF}-stimulated {EGFR} autophosphorylation in tumour cells and selectively inhibits {EGF}-stimulated tumour cell growth. In studies with mice bearing a range of human tumour-derived xenografts, Iressa given orally, once daily, inhibited tumour growth in a dose-dependent manner. Long-term ({\textgreater}3 months) Iressa treatment of xenograft-bearing mice was well tolerated, and Iressa completely inhibited the growth of xenografts derived from A431 cells which highly express {EGFR}, and induced regression of advanced A431-derived tumours. No Iressa-resistant tumours appeared during treatment, but some tumours regrew following drug withdrawal. The level of expression of {EGFR} did not determine xenograft tumour sensitivity to Iressa. These preclinical studies indicated the potential utility of Iressa in the treatment of a wide range of human tumours, and established that continuous once-daily oral dosing might be a suitable therapeutic regimen. The first clinical studies with Iressa confirmed that an oral, once-daily, regimen is generally well tolerated and shows activity in cancer patients. Phase {II} clinical trials, in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ({NSCLC}) who had been previously treated with chemotherapy, demonstrated that Iressa at a daily dose of 250 or 500 mg has a favourable safety profile and has activity. The lower (250 mg/day) dose was better tolerated and as effective as the 500 mg/day dose. In these phase {II} studies, the level of expression of {EGFR} did not predict response to Iressa treatment. In phase {III} clinical trials, addition of Iressa to standard two-drug chemotherapy regimens, in previously untreated {NSCLC} patients, failed to improve disease-free or overall survival. Studies are now underway to investigate how Iressa can be used as an alternative to or in sequence with chemotherapy in {NSCLC}, and to explore its efficacy in other tumours including head and neck, breast and colorectal.},

	abstract = {The epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of many cancers. {EGFR} is unique in that its ligand-induced dimerization is established solely by contacts between regions of the receptor that are occluded within the monomeric, unliganded state. Activation of {EGFR} depends on the formation of an asymmetric dimer of the intracellular module of two receptor molecules, a configuration observed in crystal structures of the {EGFR} kinase domain in the active state. Coupling between the extracellular and intracellular modules is achieved by a switch between alternative geometries of the transmembrane and juxtamembrane segments within the receptor dimer. As the structure of the full-length receptor is yet to be determined, here we review recent structural studies on isolated modules of {EGFR} and molecular dynamics simulations that have provided much of our current understanding of its signaling mechanism, including how its regulation is compromised by oncogenic mutations. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Biochemistry Volume 84 is June 2, 2015. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/catalog/pubdates.aspx for revised estimates.},

	abstract = {Current models put forward that the epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) is efficiently internalized via clathrin-coated pits only in response to ligand-induced activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase and is subsequently directed into a lysosomal-proteasomal degradation pathway by mechanisms that include receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitylation. Herein, we report a novel mechanism of {EGFR} internalization that does not require ligand binding, receptor kinase activity, or ubiquitylation and does not direct the receptor into a degradative pathway. Inhibition of basal protein kinase A ({PKA}) activity by H89 and the cell-permeable substrate peptide Myr-{PKI} induced internalization of 40–60\% unoccupied, inactive {EGFR}, and its accumulation into early endosomes without affecting endocytosis of transferrin and μ-opioid receptors. This effect was abrogated by interfering with clathrin function. Thus, the predominant distribution of inactive {EGFR} at the plasma membrane is not simply by default but involves a {PKA}-dependent restrictive condition resulting in receptor avoidance of endocytosis until it is stimulated by ligand. Furthermore, {PKA} inhibition may contribute to ligand-induced {EGFR} endocytosis because epidermal growth factor inhibited 26\% of {PKA} basal activity. On the other hand, H89 did not alter ligand-induced internalization of {EGFR} but doubled its half-time of down-regulation by retarding its segregation into degradative compartments, seemingly due to a delay in the receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitylation. Our results reveal that {PKA} basal activity controls {EGFR} function at two levels: 1) residence time of inactive {EGFR} at the cell surface by a process of “endocytic evasion,” modulating the accessibility of receptors to stimuli; and 2) sorting events leading to the down-regulation pathway of ligand-activated {EGFR}, determining the length of its intracellular signaling. They add a new dimension to the fine-tuning of {EGFR} function in response to cellular demands and cross talk with other signaling receptors.},

Although this receptor complex is capable of binding {EGF}, noncovalently, in quantities similar to the previously isolated 150,000 complex (Cohen, S., Carpenter, G., and King, L., Jr. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 4834-4842), the 170,000 preparation has 5 to 10 times the intrinsic kinase activity (autophosphorylation). However, the 170,000 kinase activity toward other proteins is lower than that of the 150,000 preparation. Both the 170,000 and 150,000 kinase activities are enhanced by {EGF}. The 170,000 and 150,000 proteins are also capable of forming covalent linkages to 125I-{EGF}, and each is precipitated by antisera directed against the 170,000 protein. We suggest the 150,000 protein is a proteolytic degradation product of the 170,000 protein. The {EGF}-enhanced kinase activity of the 170,000 preparation remains associated with the 125I-{EGF}-binding activity following {EGF} affinity chromatography, electrophoresis in nondenaturing gels, or immunoprecipitation with antisera directed against the sodium dodecyl sulfate ({SDS}) gel-purified 170,000 protein. These results indicate that the receptor, kinase, and substrate domains are linked, possibly covalently.},

	abstract = {Binding of {EGF} to its receptor induces dimerization of the normally monomeric receptor. Activation of its intracellular tyrosine kinase then occurs through the formation of an asymmetric kinase dimer in which one subunit, termed the “receiver” kinase, is activated by interaction with the other subunit, termed the “activator” kinase [Zhang, et al. (2006) Cell 125: 1137–1149]. Although there is significant experimental support for this model, the relationship between ligand binding and the mechanics of kinase activation are not known. Here we use luciferase fragment complementation in {EGF} receptor ({EGFR})/{ErbB}2 heterodimers to probe the mechanics of {ErbB} kinase activation. Our data support a model in which ligand binding causes the cis-kinase (the {EGFR}) to adopt the receiver position in the asymmetric dimer and to be activated first. If the {EGF} receptor is kinase active, this results in the phosphorylation of the trans-kinase ({ErbB}2). However, if the {EGF} receptor kinase is kinase dead, the {ErbB}2 kinase is never activated. Thus, activation of the kinases in the {EGFR}/{ErbB}2 asymmetric dimer occurs in a specific sequence and depends on the kinase activity of the {EGF} receptor.},

Signaling by constitutively active {NSCLC} {EGFR} mutants or the {EGFRvIII} mutant in glioblastoma has been studied intensively and the downstream signals are known. Normally, the {EGFRwt} is activated when it is exposed to ligand, resulting in activation of canonical signals such as {ERK} and Akt. The {EGFRwt} also becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and constitutively activated without ligand when it is overexpressed, but downstream signals are unclear. Recent studies have identified a noncanonical form of signaling triggered by {EGFRwt} exclusively in the absence of ligand that does not involve {ERK} or Akt activation but, instead, results in activation of the transcription factor {IRF}3. The addition of ligand turns off {IRF}3-dependent transcription and activates {ERK} and Akt. Thus, the {EGFR} triggers distinct and mutually exclusive signaling networks, depending on the presence of ligand. Furthermore, noncanonical {EGFRwt} signaling may influence response to treatment in cancer. Also, there are reports of both synergistic and antagonistic interactions between ligand-dependent {EGFRwt} and {EGFRvIII} signaling. Here, we discuss ligand-independent {EGFR} signal transduction by oncogenic {EGFR} mutants and {EGFRwt}, and review the interplay between {EGFRwt} and {EGFRvIII}.

The majority of protein phosphorylation research has been focused on serine, threonine and tyrosine that form acid-stable phosphomonoesters.

It has become increasingly evident that acid-labile protein phosphorylations play important roles in signal transduction and other regulatory processes. Beside acting as high-energy intermediates in the transfer of the phosphoryl group from donor to acceptor molecules, phosphohistidines have been found so far in histone H4, heterotrimeric G proteins, ion channel {KCa}3.1, annexin 1, P-selectin and myelin basic protein, as well as in recombinant thymidylate synthase expressed in bacterial cells. Phosphoarginines occur in histone H3, myelin basic protein and capsidic protein {VP}12 of granulosis virus, whereas phospholysine in histone H1. This overview of the current knowledge on phosphorylation of protein basic amino-acid residues takes into consideration its proved or possible roles in cell functioning. Specific requirements of studies on acid-labile protein phosphorylation are also indicated.},

Such control could likewise be of utility in artificial biotechnologies, such as biosensors, genetic logic gates, and “smart” materials, in which highly responsive behavior is of value. In nature, the control of molecular responsiveness is often achieved using “Hill-type” cooperativity, a mechanism in which sequential binding events on a multivalent receptor are coupled such that the first enhances the affinity of the next, producing a steep, higher-order dependence on target concentration. Here, we use an intrinsic-disorder–based mechanism that can be implemented without requiring detailed structural knowledge to rationally introduce this potentially useful property into several normally noncooperative biomolecules. To do so, we fabricate a tandem repeat of the receptor that is destabilized (unfolded) via the introduction of a long, unstructured loop. The first binding event requires the energetically unfavorable closing of this loop, reducing its affinity relative to that of the second binding event, which, in contrast occurs at a preformed site. Using this approach, we have rationally introduced cooperativity into three unrelated {DNA} aptamers, achieving in the best of these a Hill coefficient experimentally indistinguishable from the theoretically expected maximum. The extent of cooperativity and thus the steepness of the binding transition are, moreover, well modeled as simple functions of the energetic cost of binding-induced folding, speaking to the quantitative nature of this design strategy.},

Here, we report an unanticipated role for the inactive {EGFR} in autophagy initiation. Inactive {EGFR} interacts with the oncoprotein {LAPTM}4B that is required for the endosomal accumulation of {EGFR} upon serum starvation. Inactive {EGFR} and {LAPTM}4B stabilize each other at endosomes and recruit the exocyst subcomplex containing Sec5. We show that inactive {EGFR}, {LAPTM}4B, and the Sec5 subcomplex are required for basal and starvation-induced autophagy. {LAPTM}4B and Sec5 promote {EGFR} association with the autophagy inhibitor Rubicon, which in turn disassociates Beclin 1 from Rubicon to initiate autophagy. Thus, the oncoprotein {LAPTM}4B facilitates the role of inactive {EGFR} in autophagy initiation. This pathway is positioned to control tumor metabolism and promote tumor cell survival upon serum deprivation or metabolic stress.},

Through evolutionary pressures, specific hormones and growth factors have acquired the ability to trigger a complex coordinated “pleiotropic growth response” in their target cells. This complex response is mediated by specific cellular receptors and intracellular messengers. Teleologically then, it makes sense that in oncogenesis this growth regulating network is utilized by the production of proteins which mimic growth factors, the activated form of their receptors or, the messengers themselves. Several lines of evidence indicate that the epidermal growth factor-stimulated growth regulatory system is involved in cellular proliferation, both normal and neoplastic. Some of the effects of epidermal growth factor in carcinogenesis are separable from its direct, growth stimulatory effects. Thus, the role of epidermal growth factor in carcinogenesis is more complex than is its role in stimulating growth.},

However, simply exposing this arm is not sufficient for receptor dimerization, suggesting that additional ligand-induced dimer contacts are required. To map these contributions to the dimer interface, we individually mutated each contact suggested by crystallographic studies and analyzed the effects on receptor dimerization, activation, and ligand binding. We find that domain {II} contributes {\textgreater}90\% of the driving energy for dimerization of the extracellular region, with domain {IV} adding little. Within domain {II}, the dimerization arm forms much of the dimer interface, as expected. However, a loop from the sixth disulfide-bonded module (immediately C-terminal to the dimerization arm) also makes a critical contribution. Specific ligand-induced conformational changes in domain {II} are required for this loop to contribute to receptor dimerization, and we identify a set of ligand-induced intramolecular interactions that appear to be important in driving these changes, effectively “buttressing” the dimer interface. Our data also suggest that similar conformational changes may determine the specificity of {ErbB} receptor homo- versus heterodimerization.},

	abstract = {Epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) is an oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase. Canonically, the tyrosine kinase activity of {EGFR} is regulated by its extracellular ligands. However, ligand-independent activation of {EGFR} exists in certain cancer cells, and the underlying mechanism remains to be defined. In this study, using {PC}3 and A549 cells as a model, we have found that, in the absence of extracellular ligands, a subpopulation of {EGFR} is constitutively active, which is needed for maintaining cell proliferation. Furthermore, we have found that fatty acid synthase ({FASN})-dependent palmitoylation of {EGFR} is required for {EGFR} dimerization and kinase activation. Inhibition of {FASN} or palmitoyl acyltransferases reduced the activity and down-regulated the levels of {EGFR}, and sensitized cancer cells to {EGFR} tyrosine kinase inhibitors. It is concluded that {EGFR} can be activated intracellularly by {FASN}-dependent palmitoylation. This mechanism may serve as a new target for improving {EGFR}-based cancer therapy.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) mutations are important predictors of treatment response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors ({TKIs}) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer ({NSCLC}). However, some patients with mutations do not respond and some patients without mutations show response. We therefore need additional biomarkers to improve the selection of these patients for treatment. A promising candidate could be germline genetic variations in the {EGFR} gene that can alter protein expression or function and may influence the response to {TKIs}. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive role of genetic variations in the {EGFR} gene in advanced {NSCLC} patients treated with a {TKI}.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Genotypes for -216G{\textgreater}T, -191C{\textgreater}A and 181946C{\textgreater}T in the {EGFR} gene were retrospectively evaluated by {DNA} sequencing and allele-specific {PCR} analysis in 331 Caucasian patients with advanced {NSCLC}. Genotypes were correlated with clinical characteristics, toxicity and outcome. A multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards model while adjusting for clinically relevant factors including {EGFR} mutation status.
{RESULTS}: 181946CT or {TT} genotypes showed an association with clinical outcome compared with patients with the 181946CC genotype (disease control rate ({DCR}), 68\% versus 52\%; P=0.049; progression-free survival ({PFS}), adjusted hazard ratio ({HR})=0.74 (95\% confidence interval ({CI}): 0.55-0.99); overall survival ({OS}), adjusted {HR}=0.73 (95\% {CI}: 0.54-0.97)). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the association may be most relevant in {EGFR} mutation-positive patients ({PFS}, adjusted {HR}=0.43 (95\% {CI}: 0.22-0.82); {OS}, adjusted {HR}=0.47 (95\% {CI}: 0.24-0.93)).
{CONCLUSION}: The 181946C{\textgreater}T polymorphisms in the {EGFR} gene seems to be a potential predictor of higher {DCR}, longer {PFS} and {OS} in advanced {NSCLC} patients treated with erlotinib, especially in {EGFR} mutation-positive patients. Thus, this {SNP} may be a new potential tool for selection of patients for treatment. Prospective randomized studies are wanted to confirm our data.},

We report cell-based assays that provide evidence for active, singly ligated dimers of human {EGFR} and its homolog, {ErbB}4/{HER}4. We also report crystal structures of the {ErbB}4/{HER}4 extracellular region complexed with its ligand Neuregulin-1β that resolve two types of {ErbB} dimer when compared to {EGFR}:Ligand complexes. One type resembles the recently reported asymmetric dimer of Drosophila {EGFR} with a single high-affinity ligand bound and provides a model for singly ligated human {ErbB} dimers. These results unify models of vertebrate and invertebrate {EGFR}/{ErbB} signaling, imply that the tethered conformation of unliganded {ErbBs} evolved to prevent crosstalk among {ErbBs}, and establish a molecular basis for both negative cooperativity of ligand binding to vertebrate {ErbBs} and the absence of active {ErbB}2/{HER}2 homodimers in normal conditions.},

	abstract = {This Teaching Resource provides lecture notes, slides, and a student assignment for a two-part lecture that introduces stochastic modeling of biological systems. The first lecture uses biological examples to present the concept of cell-to-cell variability and makes the connection between the variability of single-cell measurements and concepts from statistical mechanics and probability theory. This section makes the point that for low copy number of a species, the usual differential equation formalism is no longer applicable and needs to be replaced by a probabilistic approach based on the so-called Master Equation. As an example, a simple model of gene transcription is discussed in detail, the different contributions to the relevant Master Equation are highlighted, and the equation itself is derived. The second lecture describes how, for more complex and biologically interesting applications, direct solution of the Master Equation becomes difficult. Gillespie’s algorithm, which is used in most cases of biological interest, is then introduced as a practical alternative. The lecture delves into the crux of Gillespie’s algorithm, which entails the drawing of two random numbers at each time step. It establishes the corresponding formalism, details the connection between chemical rate constants and Gillespie rates, and culminates in a description and explanation of a core {MATLAB} program for the transcriptional model considered in the first lecture. This core program, written for a single cell, is expanded by the students in the homework assignment to consider both transcription and translation.},

	abstract = {A new route to N-1-substituted pyrazolo- and pyrroloquinazolines has been developed from the known quinazolones 19 and 23, via conversion to the corresponding thiones, S-methylation to the thioethers, N-1-alkylation, and coupling with 3-bromoaniline. C-3-Substituted pyrroloquinazolines were prepared by Mannich base chemistry. A series of compounds bearing solubilizing side chains at these positions has been prepared and evaluated for inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of the isolated epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) and of its autophosphorylation in {EGF}-stimulated A431 cells. Several analogues, particularly C-3-substituted pyrroloquinazolines, retained high potency in both assays. A model for the binding of the general class of 4-anilinoquinazolines to the {EGFR} was constructed from structural information (particularly for the catalytic subunit of the {cAMP}-dependent protein kinase) and structure?activity relationships ({SAR}) in the series. In this model, the pyrrole ring in pyrroloquinazolines (and the 6- and 7-positions of quinazoline and related pyridopyrimidine inhibitors) occupies the entrance of the {ATP} binding pocket of the enzyme, with the pyrrole nitrogen located at the bottom of the cleft and the pyrrole C-3 position pointing toward a pocket corresponding to the ribose binding site of {ATP}. This allows considerable bulk tolerance for C-3 substituents and lesser but still significant bulk tolerance for N-1 substituents. The observed high selectivity of these compounds for binding to {EGFR} over other similar tyrosine kinases is attributed to the 4-anilino ring binding in an adjacent hydrophobic pocket which has an amino acid composition unique to the {EGFR}. The {SAR} seen for inhibition of the isolated enzyme by the pyrazolo- and pyrroloquinazolines discussed here is fully consistent with this binding model. For the N-1-substituted compounds, inhibition of autophosphorylation in A431 cells correlates well with inhibition of the isolated enzyme, as seen previously for related pyridopyrimidines. However, the C-3-substituted pyrroloquinazolines show unexpectedly high potencies in the autophosphorylation assay, making them of particular interest.},

	abstract = {Deregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) signaling has been correlated with the development of a variety of human carcinomas. {EGF}-induced receptor dimerization and consequent trans- auto-phosphorylation are among the earliest events in signal transduction. Binding of {EGF} is thought to induce a conformational change that consequently unfolds an ectodomain loop required for dimerization indirectly. It may also induce important allosteric changes in the cytoplasmic domain. Despite extensive knowledge on the physiological activation of {EGFR}, the effect of targeted therapies on receptor conformation is not known and this particular aspect of receptor function, which can potentially be influenced by drug treatment, may in part explain the heterogeneous clinical response among cancer patients. Here, we used Förster resonance energy transfer/fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy ({FRET}/{FLIM}) combined with two-color single-molecule tracking to study the effect of {ATP}-competitive small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors ({TKIs}) and phosphatase-based manipulation of {EGFR} phosphorylation on live cells. The distribution of dimer on-times was fitted to a monoexponential to extract dimer off-rates (koff). Our data show that pretreatment with gefitinib (active conformation binder) stabilizes the {EGFR} ligand-bound homodimer. Overexpression of {EGFR}-specific {DEP}-1 phosphatase was also found to have a stabilizing effect on the homodimer. No significant difference in the koff of the dimer could be detected when an anti-{EGFR} antibody (425 Snap single-chain variable fragment) that allows for dimerization of ligand-bound receptors, but not phosphorylation, was used. These results suggest that both the conformation of the extracellular domain and phosphorylation status of the receptor are involved in modulating the stability of the dimer. The relative fractions of these two {EGFR} subpopulations (interacting versus free) were obtained by a fractional-intensity analysis of ensemble {FRET}/{FLIM} images. Our combined imaging approach showed that both the fraction and affinity (surrogate of conformation at a single-molecule level) increased after gefitinib pretreatment or {DEP}-1 phosphatase overexpression. Using an {EGFR} mutation (I706Q, V948R) that perturbs the ability of {EGFR} to dimerize intracellularly, we showed that a modest drug-induced increase in the fraction/stability of the {EGFR} homodimer may have a significant biological impact on the tumor cell's proliferation potential.},

Comparing {DNA} synthesis in normal adult rat hepatocytes with {DNA} synthesis in hepatocytes isolated from regenerating livers, we found with minimal essential medium alone little {DNA} synthesis in normal adult rat hepatocytes and in hepatocytes isolated 4, 8, or 12 h after 70\% hepatectomy.

The addition of insulin to minimal essential medium had minimal effect on {DNA} synthesis in all hepatocytes. Addition of epidermal growth factor alone or in combination with insulin resulted in a dramatic increase in {DNA} synthesis in hepatocytes from regenerating rat liver. Increased incorporation was detectable as early as 4 h after partial hepatectomy and reached a maximum at 24 h after the operation. Results obtained with [3H]thymidine incorporation were confirmed by autoradiography and by direct {DNA} determinations in hepatocyte cultures. Epidermal growth factor binding to the hepatocytes was determined and agreed with previously reported binding studies.

	abstract = {The epidermal growth factor ({EGF}) receptor is a member of the {ErbB} family of receptors that also includes {ErbB}2, {ErbB}3, and {ErbB}4. These receptors form homo- and heterodimers in response to ligand with {ErbB}2 being the preferred dimerization partner. Here we use 125I-{EGF} binding to quantitate the interaction of the {EGF} receptor with {ErbB}2. We show that the {EGFR}/{ErbB}2 heterodimer binds {EGF} with a 7-fold higher affinity than the {EGFR} homodimer. Because it cannot bind a second ligand, the {EGFR}/{ErbB}2 heterodimer is not subject to ligand-induced dissociation caused by the negatively cooperative binding of {EGF} to the second site on the {EGFR} homodimer. This increases the stability of the heterodimer relative to the homodimer and is associated with enhanced and prolonged {EGF} receptor autophosphorylation. These effects are independent of the kinase activity of {ErbB}2 but require back-to-back dimerization of the {EGF} receptor with {ErbB}2. Back-to-back dimerization is also required for phosphorylation of {ErbB}2. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the apparent preference of the {EGF} receptor for dimerizing with {ErbB}2 and suggest that the phosphorylation of {ErbB}2 occurs largely in the context of the {EGFR}/{ErbB}2 heterodimer, rather than through lateral phosphorylation of isolated {ErbB}2 subunits.},

	abstract = {The receptor for epidermal growth factor ({EGF}) is a glycosylated transmembrane phosphoprotein that exhibits {EGF}-stimulable protein tyrosine kinase activity. On {EGF} stimulation, the receptor undergoes a self-phosphorylation reaction at tyrosine residues located primarily in the extreme carboxyl-terminal region of the protein. Using enzymatically active {EGF} receptor purified by immunoaffinity chromatography from A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells, the self-phosphorylation reaction has been characterized as a rapid, intramolecular process which is maximal at 30-37 degrees C and exhibits a very low Km for {ATP} (0.2 {microM}). When phosphorylation of exogenous peptide substrates was measured as a function of receptor self-phosphorylation, tyrosine kinase activity was found to be enhanced two to threefold at 1-2 mol of phosphate per mol of receptor. Analysis of the dependence of the tyrosine kinase activity on {ATP} concentration yielded hyperbolic kinetics when plotted in double-reciprocal fashion, indicating that {ATP} can serve as an activator of the enzyme. Higher concentrations of peptide substrates were found to inhibit both the self- and peptide phosphorylation, but this inhibition could be overcome by first self-phosphorylating the enzyme. These results suggest that self-phosphorylation can remove a competitive/inhibitory constraint so that certain exogenous substrates can have greater access to the enzyme active site. In addition to self-phosphorylation, the {EGF} receptor can be phosphorylated on threonine residues by the calcium- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C. The sites on the {EGF} receptor phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C are identical to the sites phosphorylated on the receptor isolated from A431 cells exposed to the tumor promoters 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate or teleocidin. This phosphorylation of the {EGF} receptor results in a suppression of its tyrosine kinase and {EGF} binding activities both in vivo and in vitro. The {EGF} receptor can thus be variably regulated by phosphorylation: self-phosphorylation can enhance tyrosine kinase activity whereas protein kinase C-catalyzed phosphorylation can depress enzyme activity. Because these two phosphorylations account for only a fraction of the phosphate present in the {EGF} receptor in vivo, other protein kinases can apparently phosphorylate the receptor and these may exert additional controls on {EGF} receptor/kinase function.},

Cells that synthesize {DNA} in response to physiological concentrations of {EGF} (10-11 to 10-10 M) are insensitive to physiological concentrations of insulin (10-11 to 10-10 M) and respond only minimally to very high concentrations of this hormone (10-6 M). The biological activity of {EGF} is paralleled by binding of this peptide to fibroblasts in a specific and saturable manner; the dissociation constant is about 800 {pM}. The binding of {EGF} is unaffected by either insulin or cholera toxin. Cholera toxin inhibits the action of both {EGF} and serum. Suppression of {DNA} synthesis is observed at 0.02 {pM} toxin, and is maximal at about 2 {pM}. Cells treated with cholera toxin at these concentrations appear to be otherwise viable by several criteria. The stimulatory effects of {EGF} are also inhibited by theophylline and dibutyryl cyclic {AMP} separately or in combination.

	abstract = {Background
The Hill function and the related Hill model are used frequently to study processes in the living cell. There are very few studies investigating the situations in which the model can be safely used. For example, it has been shown, at the mean field level, that the dose response curve obtained from a Hill model agrees well with the dose response curves obtained from a more complicated Adair-Klotz model, provided that the parameters of the Adair-Klotz model describe strongly cooperative binding. However, it has not been established whether such findings can be extended to other properties and non-mean field (stochastic) versions of the same, or other, models.

Results
In this work a rather generic quantitative framework for approaching such a problem is suggested. The main idea is to focus on comparing the particle number distribution functions for Hill's and Adair-Klotz's models instead of investigating a particular property (e.g. the dose response curve). The approach is valid for any model that can be mathematically related to the Hill model. The Adair-Klotz model is used to illustrate the technique. One main and two auxiliary similarity measures were introduced to compare the distributions in a quantitative way. Both time dependent and the equilibrium properties of the similarity measures were studied.

Conclusions
A strongly cooperative Adair-Klotz model can be replaced by a suitable Hill model in such a way that any property computed from the two models, even the one describing stochastic features, is approximately the same. The quantitative analysis showed that boundaries of the regions in the parameter space where the models behave in the same way exhibit a rather rich structure.},

However, how two independent classes of sites arise from the expression of a single {EGF} receptor protein has never been adequately explained. Using a new analytical approach involving the simultaneous fitting of binding isotherms from cells expressing increasing levels of {EGF} receptors, we show that (125)I-{EGF}-binding data can be completely explained by a model involving negative cooperativity in an aggregating system. This approach provides an experimentally determined value for the monomer-dimer equilibrium constant, which, for wild-type {EGF} receptors, corresponds to approximately 50,000 receptors per cell. Therefore, changes in receptor expression within the physiological range can modulate the outcome of a signaling stimulus. Analysis of the L680N-{EGF} receptor mutant, in which the formation of asymmetric kinase domain dimers is blocked, indicates that the kinase dimers make a substantial energetic contribution to the ligand-independent association of {EGF} receptor monomers, but are not necessary for negative cooperativity. The model accurately predicts the behavior of receptor mutants, such as the dimerization-defective Y246D-{EGF} receptor, which exhibit a single class of binding sites and provides a framework for understanding secondary dimer formation and lateral signaling in the {EGF} receptor family.},

	abstract = {Summary
Transmembrane signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) involves ligand-induced dimerization and allosteric regulation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Crystallographic studies have shown how ligand binding induces dimerization of the {EGFR} extracellular region but cannot explain the “high-affinity” and “low-affinity” classes of cell-surface {EGF}-binding sites inferred from curved Scatchard plots. From a series of crystal structures of the Drosophila {EGFR} extracellular region, we show here how Scatchard plot curvature arises from negatively cooperative ligand binding. The first ligand-binding event induces formation of an asymmetric dimer with only one bound ligand. The unoccupied site in this dimer is structurally restrained, leading to reduced affinity for binding of the second ligand, and thus negative cooperativity. Our results explain the cell-surface binding characteristics of {EGF} receptors and suggest how individual {EGFR} ligands might stabilize distinct dimeric species with different signaling properties.

	abstract = {Receptors for insulin and epidermal growth factor ({EGF}) have been studied in confluent cultured intact human fibroblast monolayers. 125-I-{EGF} binds specifically to fibroblast monolayers. Half-maximal binding is observed at 4 times 10 minus 10 M {EGF}; at saturation of binding approximately 4 times 10-4 molecules of {EGF} are bound per cell. 125-I-Insulin is also bound specifically by intact monolayers with half-maximal binding observed at 10 minus 9 M insulin; about 4 times 10-3 molecules of insulin are bound per cell at saturation. Both insulin and {EGF} stimulate thymidine incorporation and alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake. A half-maximal effect for insulin is observed at about 10 minus 9 M, both for the stimulation of thymidine incorporation and for the stimulation of alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake; for {EGF}, half-maximal stimulation of both thymidine incorporation and alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake is observed at 10 minus 10 M {EGF}. {EGF} causes an apparent greater stimulation of thymidine incorporation than does insulin, whereas the stimulation of alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake is the same for both insulin and {EGF}. The degree of stimulation of alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake by either insulin or {EGF} varied (1.2- to 2-fold) from one batch of cells to another, as did the measured values of the apparent K-m (average value 1 {mM}, range 0.6 to 2 {mM}) and V-max (average, 0.82, range 0.78 to 0.87 nmol/100 mug of protein per min) for alpha-aminoisobutyrate. Nonetheless, the apparent K-m of each peptide for stimulation of alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake was independent of the degree of increase in alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake, and was constant from one batch of cells to another. The peptide-mediated stimulation of alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake can be attributed to a decrease in the apparent K-m for alpha-aminoisobutyrate (e.g. for insulin) from 0.70 to 0.57 {mM}; for {EGF} from 0.87 to 0.66 {mM}) and a concomitant increase in the apparent V-max for alpha-aminoisobutyrate (e.g. for insulin from 0.78 to 0.87 and for {EGF} from 0.80 to 0.84 nmol/min/100 mug of cell protein). The stimulation requires a 40- to 60-min period of preincubation with either peptide and is blocked by pretreating cells with cycloheximide. In the presence of ouabain, both peptides inhibit rather than stimulate alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake; ouabain lowers the basal rate of alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake. The uptake of 3-0-methyl-D-glucose is not affected by either {EGF} or insulin under conditions where insulin stimulates fat cell transport. These observations indicate that cultured human fibroblasts possess specific binding sites for insulin and {EGF}, which sites can be related to two actions of the peptides: stimulation of thymidine incorporation and alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake.},

	abstract = {To investigate the role of receptor aggregation in {EGF} binding, we construct a mathematical model describing receptor dimerization (and higher levels of aggregation) that permits an analysis of the influence of receptor aggregation on ligand binding. We answer two questions: (a) Can Scatchard plots of {EGF} binding data be analyzed productively in terms of two noninteracting receptor populations with different affinities if {EGF} induced receptor aggregation occurs? No. If two affinities characterize aggregated and monomeric {EGF} receptors, we show that the Scatchard plot should have curvature characteristic of positively cooperative binding, the opposite of that observed. Thus, the interpretation that the high affinity population represents aggregated receptors and the low affinity population nonaggregated receptors is wrong. If the two populations are interpreted without reference to receptor aggregation, an important determinant of Scatchard plot shape is ignored. (b) Can a model for {EGF} receptor aggregation and {EGF} binding be consistent with the "negative curvature" (i.e., curvature characteristic of negatively cooperative binding) observed in most Scatchard plots of {EGF} binding data? Yes. In addition, the restrictions on the model parameters required to obtain negatively curved Scatchard plots provide new information about binding and aggregation. In particular, {EGF} binding to aggregated receptors must be negatively cooperative, i.e., binding to a receptor in a dimer (or higher oligomer) having one receptor already bound occurs with lower affinity than the initial binding event. A third question we consider is whether the model we present can be used to detect the presence of mechanisms other than receptor aggregation that are contributing to Scatchard plot curvature. For the membrane and cell binding data we analyzed, the best least squares fits of the model to each of the four data sets deviate systematically from the data, indicating that additional factors are also important in shaping the binding curves. Because we have controlled experimentally for many sources of receptor heterogeneity, we have limited the potential explanations for residual Scatchard plot curvature.},

	abstract = {Author {SummaryEpidermal} growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) molecules are of central importance in cellular communication. Embedded in the cell membrane, these receptors bind epidermal growth factor ({EGF}) molecules outside the cell and translate this binding into specific biochemical signals inside the cell, which in turn trigger cell proliferation, migration, or differentiation. {EGFR} dysfunction has been implicated in a variety of cancers, and {EGFR}-targeting drugs are commonly used in cancer treatments. It has been widely assumed that the extracellular portion of an {EGFR} molecule protrudes perpendicularly from the cell membrane. In detailed, atomic-level computer simulations, however, we find that it lies down on the membrane, placing its {EGF}-binding site adjacent to the membrane surface. We further show that {EGF} may interact with {EGFR} in two distinct ways (with or without the involvement of the membrane). This may explain the experimental finding that an {EGF} molecule binds to {EGFR} more weakly at higher {EGF} concentration. This phenomenon, which is a manifestation of an underlying negative cooperativity, is an important but poorly understood characteristic of {EGFR} activity. In this study, we also model and analyze the glycan chains attached to {EGFR}, which are integral to its behavior in living cells.},

	abstract = {The overexpression and aberrant function of the epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) and its ligands in several human carcinomas have provided a rationale for targeting this signaling network with novel treatment approaches. The epidermal growth factor receptor–tyrosine kinase ({EGFR}-{TK}) is a selective target for inhibiting cancer because it is activated in many tumor cells, yet is strictly controlled in normal cells. The {EGFR}-{TK} initiates diverse signal transduction pathways in tumor cells that have a profound effect on their biology. Activation of the {EGFR}-{TK} provides signals that drive dysregulated proliferation, invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis, and enhanced cell survival. Therefore, the {EGFR}-{TK} is a promising drug target for many types of solid tumors, and its inhibition has potential in both the treatment and prevention of these neoplasias. Based on the structure and function of the {EGFR}, two antireceptor therapeutic strategies have been developed. The first strategy uses humanized monoclonal antibodies generated against the receptor's ligand-binding, extracellular domain. These antibodies block binding of receptor-activating ligands and, in some cases, can induce receptor endocytosis and downregulation. The second approach uses small molecules that compete with adenosine triphosphate for binding to the receptor's kinase pocket, thus blocking receptor activation and the transduction of postreceptor signals. Early clinical studies suggest that both of these approaches, either alone or in combination with standard anticancer therapies, are well tolerated and can induce clinical responses and tumor stabilization in a variety of common carcinomas. {ZD}1839 (Iressa; {AstraZeneca} Pharmaceuticals {LP}, Wilmington, {DE}) is the {EGFR}-{TK} inhibitor furthest along in clinical development, and it is currently being investigated in a variety of solid tumors, including non–small-cell lung cancer.

Two Phase {II} trials ({IDEAL} [Iressa Dose Evaluation in Advanced Lung Cancer]-1 and -2), evaluated the efficacy of gefitinib in advanced {NSCLC} patients who received ≤ 2 ({IDEAL}1) or ≥ 2 ({IDEAL}2) previous chemotherapy regimens. The response rate and disease control rate in {IDEAL}1 and -2 was 18/12\% and 54/42\%, respectively. The median survival time and one-year survival rate in both studies were 7 months and 30\%, respectively. As gefitinib has demonstrated antitumour activity and an acceptable tolerability profile not typically associated with cytotoxic adverse events, such as hematological toxicities, combinations with cytotoxic drugs have been evaluated. Disappointingly, in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced {NSCLC}, gefitinib 250 and 500 mg/day combined with platinum-based chemotherapy (gemcitabine/cisplatin or paclitaxel/carboplatin) did not produce prolonged survival, compared with chemotherapy alone in two large, randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-centre Phase {III} trials ({INTACT} [Iressa {NSCLC} Trial Assessing Combination Treatment]-1 and -2). Furthermore, in a recent randomised, placebo-controlled, Phase {III} trial ({ISEL}: {IRESSA} Survival Evaluation in Lung cancer), gefitinib failed to prolong survival compared with placebo in patients with advanced {NSCLC} who had failed one or more lines of chemotherapy. Subgroup analysis of {ISEL} suggested improved survival in patients of Asian origin and non-smokers. In addition, subset analyses of {IDEAL} and several retrospective studies have indicated that female gender, adenocarcinoma histology (especially bronchial alveolar carcinoma), non-smoker status and Asian ethnicity are factors which predict to response to gefitinib. Two types of somatic mutation clustered around the {ATP} binding pocket in the tyrosine kinase domain of the {EGFR} gene have been reported as possible surrogate biological markers for predicting response to gefitinib.

Gefitinib has demonstrated encouraging efficacy in advanced {NSCLC} in phase {II} trials in pretreated patients, and a phase I trial of gefitinib in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin showed favorable tolerability.
Patients and Methods This was a phase {III} randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial in chemotherapy-naive patients with unresectable stage {III} or {IV} {NSCLC}. All patients received up to six cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin 80 mg/m2 on day 1 and gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of the 3-week cycle) plus either gefitinib 500 mg/d, gefitinib 250 mg/d, or placebo. Daily gefitinib or placebo was continued until disease progression. End points included overall survival (primary), time to progression, response rates, and safety evaluation.
Results A total of 1,093 patients were enrolled. There was no difference in efficacy end points between the treatment groups: for the gefitinib 500 mg/d, gefitinib 250 mg/d, and placebo groups, respectively, median survival times were 9.9, 9.9, and 10.9 months (global ordered log-rank [{GOLrank}] P = .4560), median times to progression were 5.5, 5.8, and 6.0 months ({GOLrank}; P = .7633), and response rates were 49.7\%, 50.3\%, and 44.8\%. No significant unexpected adverse events were seen.
Conclusion Gefitinib in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced {NSCLC} did not have improved efficacy over gemcitabine and cisplatin alone. The reasons for this remain obscure and require further preclinical testing.},

	abstract = {The epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) is a transmembrane receptor involved in the regulation of a complex array of essential biological processes such as cell proliferation and survival. Dysregulation of {EGFR} signaling network has been frequently reported in multiple human cancers and has been associated with the processes of tumor development, growth, proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis. Inhibition of the {EGFR} was associated with antitumor effects in preclinical models. On the bases of these data, therapeutics targeting the {EGFR} were explore in clinical trials. {TarcevaTM}({OSI}-774, {OSI} Pharmaceuticals, Uniondale, {NY}) is a small molecule selective inhibitor of the {EGFR} tyrosine kinase ({TK}). In preclinical studies, {TarcevaTMinhibited} the phosphorylation of the {EGFR} in a dose and concentration dependent manner resulting in cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Inin vivostudies, the agent caused tumor growth inhibition and shoved synergistic effects when combined with conventional chemotherapy. Subsequent single agent phase I studies and phase I studies in combination with chemotherapy demonstrated that the agent has a good safety profile and induced tumor growth inhibition in a substantial number of patients with a variety of different solid tumor. Preliminary report from phase {II} studies confirmed the excellent tolerability of {TarcevaTMas} well as showed encouraging preliminary activity. Phase {III} studies have either been completed or are ongoing in several tumor types such as lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. In summary, {TarcevaTMis} a novel inhibitor of the {EGFR} {TK} which has shown promising activity in initial studies and is currently undergoing full development as an anticancer drug.},

	abstract = {The epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) is overexpressed in a significant percentage of carcinomas and contributes to the malignant phenotype. {CP}-358,774 is a directly acting inhibitor of human {EGFR} tyrosine kinase with an {IC}50 of 2 nm and reduces {EGFR} autophosphorylation in intact tumor cells with an {IC}50 of 20 nm. This inhibition is selective for {EGFR} tyrosine kinase relative to other tyrosine kinases we have examined, both in assays of isolated kinases and whole cells. At doses of 100 mg/kg, {CP}-358,774 completely prevents {EGF}-induced autophosphorylation of {EGFR} in human {HN}5 tumors growing as xenografts in athymic mice and of the hepatic {EGFR} of the treated mice. {CP}-358,774 inhibits the proliferation of {DiFi} human colon tumor cells at submicromolar concentrations in cell culture and blocks cell cycle progression at the G1 phase. This inhibitor produces a marked accumulation of retinoblastoma protein in its underphosphorylated form and accumulation of p27KIP1 in {DiFi} cells, which may contribute to the cell cycle block. Inhibition of the {EGFR} also triggers apoptosis in these cells as determined by formation of {DNA} fragments and other criteria. These results indicate that {CP}-358,774 has potential for the treatment of tumors that are dependent on the {EGFR} pathway for proliferation or survival.},

	abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that methylation of {RTKs} should be restricted to intracellular sites. Alterations - such as deletion, mutation, and proteolytic cleavage events - to the extracellular ligand binding and dimer interface domains of the {EGFR} can induce {EGFR} dimer formation, leading to aberrant receptor activation and oncogenic activity. Recently, the extracellular domain of {EGFR} was also shown to be methylated, suggesting that posttranslational protein methylation events directed to the extracellular dimer interface provide another mechanism to regulate the {EGFR} activation state by modulating receptor dimerization. Critically, these methylation events abrogate response to conformation-specific therapeutic antibodies such as cetuximab. In this issue of the {JCI}, Liao et al. investigate the role of protein arginine methyltransferase I ({PRMT}1) in regulating {EGFR} function in colorectal cancer. The authors provide evidence that methylation of R198 and R200 within the dimer interface enhances growth factor ligand binding and cetuximab resistance through induction and stabilization of the active {EGFR} dimer conformation. Delineation of these and other subtleties involved in oncogenic {RTK} activation and their response to targeted therapies should facilitate the development of improved antibody-based treatments.},

	abstract = {Summary Since the mitogenic action of {EGF} is mediated by ligand-induced autophosphorylation of the {EGF} receptor ({EGFR}), and {EGFR} is commonly overexpressed in solid human tumours, inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase activity ({RTK}) could prove to be effective antitumour agents. Screening of a compound library using an {EGF}-{RTK} enzyme prepared from human tumour derived A431 cells identified a series of potent ({IC}50{\textless}1{µM}) enzyme inhibitors. These inhibitors are quinazolines bearing a variety of substituted anilines at the 4-position. The most potent 4-anilinoquinazolines ({IC}50 ≅ 20nM) have small non-polar meta substituents on the aniline ring, and are competitive with {ATP} and non-competitive with substrate. The growth inhibitory activity of these agents was assessed in vitro using {KB} cells (human oral squamous tumour) grown in the absence or presence of {EGF}. A selected compound, 4-(3-chloroanilino)quinazoline ({CAQ}), inhibited {EGF}-stimulated growth in a concentration dependent manner and complete blockade was observed at concentrations (1–10 µM) which had no effect on basal growth. Selectivity of growth inhibition by {CAQ} was further exemplified in {IGF}1-stimulated {KB} cells where no effect was detected at concentrations which completely blocked {EGF}-stimulated growth. Similarly, {CAQ} blocked {TGFα}-stimulated growth in {MCF}-7 human breast cancer cells without affecting insulin-stimulated growth. These studies define a novel class of {EGF}-{RTK} inhibitors which are also potent and selective inhibitors of {EGF}-stimulated human tumour cell growthin vitro.},

A map of molecular interactions of the {EGFR} signaling system is a valuable resource for research in this area. In this paper, we present a comprehensive pathway map of {EGFR} signaling and other related pathways. The map reveals that the overall architecture of the pathway is a bow-tie (or hourglass) structure with several feedback loops.

	abstract = {The interaction of insulin with a purified and well characterized preparation of liver plasma membranes has been studied. The time course of binding of 125I-insulin and displacement of tracer at the plateau of binding was measured as a function of temperature and ionic strength. Hormone tracer concentrations were in the low physiologic range. The reaction is complex and includes reversible binding of insulin to its receptor and degradation of both insulin and receptor. The degrading reactions were minimized by using low to medium membrane concentrations and were corrected for by measuring the intact insulin remaining. When the binding reaction was studied over the range of 0.06 to 1000 ng per ml of insulin at 30°, the data fit a model with a minimum of three classes of receptor sites: a high affinity low capacity site with a K of 2.0 x 109 m-1 and a capacity of 5 x 10-14 moles per mg of membrane protein; a low affinity-high capacity site with a K of 2.1 x 108 m-1 and a capacity of 1.5 x 10-12 moles per mg of membrane protein; and a very low affinity-high capacity site ("nonspecific site") representing about 5\% of the total tracer binding. Both the affinity and binding capacity are influenced by temperature and ionic strength. Kinetic data for insulin receptor complex dissociation are also consistent with heterogeneity of receptor sites. Discrepancies in the literature between the number of reported classes of insulin receptor sites and their affinity constants are discussed in terms of the variables of this complex reaction.},

	abstract = {Insulin interactions with human lymphocytes in established cultures and with isolated peripheral lymphocytes have been studied using 125I-insulin. Receptors in circulating lymphocytes are indistinguishable from those found in cultured cells, and the lymphocyte receptors show striking similarities to those structures described in fat cell and liver preparations. In lymphocytes, the ability of insulin or insulin analogues to inhibit binding of 125I-insulin is directly proportional to the ability of that preparation to inhibit binding of labeled hormone to purified liver membranes or to stimulate glucose oxidation in the fat cell.
Binding of 125I-insulin to lymphocytes is a rapid and reversible process. Binding is maximal at 15°. Dissociation rate studies revealed a biphasic curve and the constants obtained were 8.3 x 10-5 s-1 and 8.3 x 10-4 s-1. The apparent affinity constants of the two orders of binding sites in the cultured lymphocytes were 1.2 x 1010 m-1 and 1.1 x 109 m-1, whereas in the normal circulating lymphocytes the values were 2.0 x 109 m-1 and 1.4 x 108 m-1. At 30° there is very little degradation of labeled insulin by lymphocytes, and at 15° there is no detectable degradation with cultured or circulating cells.
Binding of 125I-insulin to cultured lymphocytes is unaffected by Ca++, Mg++, or {EDTA}. The optimum {pH} for binding occurs at about 7.8. Insulin binding to cells is unaffected by digestion with {DNase}, {RNase}, or neuraminidase. However, tryptic digestion destroys the capacity of the cells to bind insulin.},

	abstract = {Background
The Hill function and the related Hill model are used frequently to study processes in the living cell. There are very few studies investigating the situations in which the model can be safely used. For example, it has been shown, at the mean field level, that the dose response curve obtained from a Hill model agrees well with the dose response curves obtained from a more complicated Adair-Klotz model, provided that the parameters of the Adair-Klotz model describe strongly cooperative binding. However, it has not been established whether such findings can be extended to other properties and non-mean field (stochastic) versions of the same, or other, models.

Results
In this work a rather generic quantitative framework for approaching such a problem is suggested. The main idea is to focus on comparing the particle number distribution functions for Hill's and Adair-Klotz's models instead of investigating a particular property (e.g. the dose response curve). The approach is valid for any model that can be mathematically related to the Hill model. The Adair-Klotz model is used to illustrate the technique. One main and two auxiliary similarity measures were introduced to compare the distributions in a quantitative way. Both time dependent and the equilibrium properties of the similarity measures were studied.

Conclusions
A strongly cooperative Adair-Klotz model can be replaced by a suitable Hill model in such a way that any property computed from the two models, even the one describing stochastic features, is approximately the same. The quantitative analysis showed that boundaries of the regions in the parameter space where the models behave in the same way exhibit a rather rich structure.},

	abstract = {The estrogen receptor dimerizes and exhibits cooperative ligand binding as part of its normal functioning. Interaction of the estrogen receptor with its ligands is mediated by a C-terminal hormone-binding domain ({HBD}), and residues within the {HBD} are thought to contribute to dimerization. To examine dimer interactions in the isolated {HBD}, a human estrogen receptor {HBD} fragment was expressed in high yield as a cleavable fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The isolated {HBD} peptide exhibited affinity for estradiol, ligand discrimination, and cooperative estradiol binding (Hill coefficient ∼1.6) similar to the full-length protein. Circular dichroism spectroscopy suggests that the {HBD} contains significant amounts of α-helix (∼60\%) and some β-strand (∼7\%) and that ligand binding induces little change in secondary structure. {HBD} dimer dissociation, measured using size exclusion chromatography, exhibited a half-life of ∼1.2 h, which ligand binding increased ∼3-fold (estradiol) to ∼4-fold (4-hydroxytamoxifen). These results suggest that the isolated estrogen receptor {HBD} dimerizes and undergoes conformational changes associated with cooperative ligand binding in a manner comparable to the full-length protein, and that one effect of ligand binding is to alter the receptor dimer dissociation kinetics.},

	abstract = {Muscarinic receptors were solubilized from porcine atria in digitonin-cholate and were purified by chromatography on {DEAE}-Sepharose and 3-(2′-aminobenzhydryloxy)tropane-Sepharose. The product identified on Western blots migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 60-75 {kDa}, with additional bands indicative of homotrimers (190 {kDa}) and homotetramers (240 {kDa}). Receptor eluted from the affinity column was accompanied by a mixture of guanyl nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) identified on Western blots as Gi1/2, Go, Gq/11, and Gs (preparation M2G); the G-proteins were largely removed by further processing on hydroxyapatite (preparation M2). Solubilized purified receptors bound muscarinic ligands in an apparently cooperative manner. In studies at equilibrium, the antagonists [3H]{AF}-{DX} 384, N-[3H]methylscopolamine ({NMS}), and quinuclidinylbenzilate ({QNB}) revealed Hill coefficients between about 0.8 and 1.2. Also, the apparent capacity for [3H]{QNB} exceeded that for [3H]{AF}-{DX} 384 and [3H]{NMS} by about 1.5-fold in M2 and by 2-fold in M2G. Binding to M2G at high concentrations of [3H]{QNB} was fully inhibited by unlabeled {NMS}, which therefore affected sites not labeled at similar concentrations of [3H]{NMS}. Oxotremorine-M displayed a biphasic inhibitory effect on the binding of [3H]{AF}-{DX} 384 in M2 and M2G, suggesting that multiple states of affinity are intrinsic to the receptor; 5′-guanylylimidodiphosphate was without appreciable effect in M2 but resulted in a bell-shaped binding profile for the agonist in M2G. All of the data can be described in terms of cooperative interactions within a receptor that is at least tetravalent and presumably an oligomer. In the context of the model, copurifying G-proteins and guanyl nucleotides serve to regulate the degree of cooperativity between successive equivalents of muscarinic ligands.},

However, simply exposing this arm is not sufficient for receptor dimerization, suggesting that additional ligand-induced dimer contacts are required. To map these contributions to the dimer interface, we individually mutated each contact suggested by crystallographic studies and analyzed the effects on receptor dimerization, activation, and ligand binding. We find that domain {II} contributes {\textgreater}90\% of the driving energy for dimerization of the extracellular region, with domain {IV} adding little. Within domain {II}, the dimerization arm forms much of the dimer interface, as expected. However, a loop from the sixth disulfide-bonded module (immediately C-terminal to the dimerization arm) also makes a critical contribution. Specific ligand-induced conformational changes in domain {II} are required for this loop to contribute to receptor dimerization, and we identify a set of ligand-induced intramolecular interactions that appear to be important in driving these changes, effectively “buttressing” the dimer interface. Our data also suggest that similar conformational changes may determine the specificity of {ErbB} receptor homo- versus heterodimerization.},

	abstract = {The focus of this review paper is factors affecting data interpretation in ligand binding assays under equilibrium conditions. Protocols for determining Kd (the equilibrium dissociation constant) and {KdA} (the equilibrium inhibitor constant) for receptor ligands are discussed. The basic theory describing the interaction of a radiotracer and an unlabelled competitor ligand with a receptor is developed. Inappropriate experimental design may result in ligand depletion and non-attainment of equilibrium, distorting the calculation of Kd and {KdA}. Strategies, both theoretical and practical, will be given to avoid and correct such errors, thus leading to the determination of reliable values for these constants. In determining {KdA} from competition binding studies, two additional concepts are discussed. First, the necessity to measure an adequate specific binding signal from the bound radiotracer ligand limits the range of affinity constants that can be measured: a particular set of assay conditions may lead to an upper limit on the apparent affinity of unlabelled ligands. Second, an extension of the basic assay methodology can indicate whether the interaction between the tracer and a test ligand is mediated by a competitive or an allosteric mechanism. Finally, the review ends with a discussion of two factors that are often overlooked: buffer composition and the temperature at which the assay is conducted, and the impact these can have on affinity measurements and the understanding of drug interactions.

Using computer modeling, we confirmed that the thermodynamic constraints of a monomer-dimer equilibrium system result in convex Scatchard plots in agreement with experimental data, including the progression to linearity at low receptor concentrations. This technique yielded estimates of the equilibrium constant for dimerization (approx. 10(10) to 10(14) M-1). The dose-response characteristics of the monomer-dimer equilibrium system revealed steep dose-response curves that were sensitive to the receptor concentration.

Because there is clear evidence of receptor dimerization, these nonlinear Scatchard plots can reflect cooperativity on agonist binding to the two binding sites in the dimer. According to this, the “two-state dimer receptor model” has been recently derived. In this article, the performance of the model has been analyzed in fitting data of agonist binding to A1 adenosine receptors, which are an example of receptor displaying concave downward Scatchard plots. Analysis of agonist/antagonist competition data for dopamine D1 receptors using the two-state dimer receptor model has also been performed. Although fitting to the two-state dimer receptor model was similar to the fitting to the “two-independent-site receptor model”, the former is simpler, and a discrimination test selects the two-state dimer receptor model as the best. This model was also very robust in fitting data of estrogen binding to the estrogen receptor, for which Scatchard plots are concave upward. On the one hand, the model would predict the already demonstrated existence of estrogen receptor dimers. On the other hand, the model would predict that concave upward Scatchard plots reflect positive cooperativity, which can be neither predicted nor explained by assuming the existence of two different affinity states. In summary, the two-state dimer receptor model is good for fitting data of binding to dimeric receptors displaying either linear, concave upward, or concave downward Scatchard plots},

However, the effects and implications of differences in {GR} concentration have not been fully elucidated. Using three statistically different {GR} concentrations in transiently transfected {COS}-1 cells, we demonstrate, using co-immunoprecipitation ({CoIP}) and fluorescent resonance energy transfer ({FRET}), that high levels of wild type {GR} ({wtGR}), but not of dimerization deficient {GR} ({GRdim}), display ligand-independent dimerization. Whole-cell saturation ligand-binding experiments furthermore establish that positive cooperative ligand-binding, with a concomitant increased ligand-binding affinity, is facilitated by ligand-independent dimerization at high concentrations of {wtGR}, but not {GRdim}. The down-stream consequences of ligand-independent dimerization at high concentrations of {wtGR}, but not {GRdim}, are shown to include basal priming of the system as witnessed by ligand-independent transactivation of both a {GRE}-containing promoter-reporter and the endogenous glucocorticoid ({GC})-responsive gene, {GILZ}, as well as ligand-independent loading of {GR} onto the {GILZ} promoter. Pursuant to the basal priming of the system, addition of ligand results in a significantly greater modulation of transactivation potency than would be expected solely from the increase in ligand-binding affinity. Thus ligand-independent dimerization of the {GR} at high concentrations primes the system, through ligand-independent {DNA} loading and transactivation, which together with positive cooperative ligand-binding increases the potency of {GR} agonists and shifts the bio-character of partial {GR} agonists. Clearly {GR}-levels are a major factor in determining the sensitivity to {GCs} and a critical factor regulating transcriptional programs.},

However, an increasing number of studies show that many G-protein-coupled heptahelical membrane receptors ({HMR}) are expressed in the plasma membrane as dimers. We here review the approaches for fitting ligand binding data that are based on the existence of receptor monomers and also the new ones based on the existence of receptor dimers. The reasons for equivocal interpretations of the fitting of data to receptor dimers, assuming they are monomers, are also discussed. A recently devised model for receptor dimers provides a new approach for fitting data that eventually gives more accurate and physiological relevant parameters. Fitting data using the new procedure gives not only the equilibrium dissociation constants for high- and low-affinity binding to receptor dimers but also a “cooperativity index” that reflects the molecular communication within the dimer. A comprehensive way to fit binding data from saturation isotherms and from competition assays to a dimer receptor model is reported and compared with the traditional way of fitting data. The new procedure can be applied to any receptor forming dimers; from receptor tyrosine kinases to intracellular receptors (e.g., estrogen receptor) and in general for ligand binding to proteins forming dimers.},

	abstract = {Extracts containing wild-type or mutant human estrogen receptor ({ER}) have been used to study the binding of {ER} to its responsive element ({ERE}). Estradiol (E2) or the antiestrogen hydroxytamoxifen is required for {ER} binding as assayed by gel retardation. The {DNA} binding domain ({DBD}) encompasses the highly conserved region C. Both intact {ER}-E2 complexes and {ER} mutants truncated for the hormone binding domain ({HBD}) bind as dimers to an {ERE}. However, an {HBD}-truncated {ER} binds less tightly to an {ERE} than an intact {ER}-E2 complex. The {DBD} and the {HBD} contain a constitutive and a stronger {ER}-induced dimerization function, respectively. Thus, in addition to inducing the activation function associated with the {HBD}, estrogen plays a crucial role in the formation of stable {ER} dimers that bind tightly to {ERE}.},

	abstract = {The existence of intramembrane receptor–receptor interactions for heptaspanning membrane receptors is now fully accepted, but a model considering dimers as the basic unit that binds to two ligand molecules is lacking. Here, we propose a two-state-dimer model in which the ligand-induced conformational changes from one component of the dimer are communicated to the other. Our model predicts cooperativity in binding, which is relevant because the other current models fail to address this phenomenon satisfactorily. Our two-state-dimer model also predicts the variety of responses elicited by full or partial agonists, neutral antagonists and inverse agonists. This model can aid our understanding of the operation of heptaspanning receptors and receptor channels, and, potentially, be important for improving the treatment of cardiovascular, neurological and neuropsychyatric diseases.},

	abstract = {Nuclear receptors form strong dimers that are essential for their function as transcription factors, and it is thought that ligand binding can affect dimer stability. In this report, we describe convenient fluorescence resonance energy transfer ({FRET})-based methods for measuring the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of dimers of the estrogen receptor-alpha ligand-binding domain ({ERalpha}-{LBD}). We have developed receptors that are chemically labeled with a single fluorophore in a site-specific manner. These fluorophore-labeled {ERs} are functional and can be used to measure directly the affinity and stability of {ERalpha}-{LBD} dimers. Our results indicate that unliganded {ERalpha}-{LBDs} exist as very stable dimers and that the dissociation rate of these dimers is slow (t(1/2)=39 +/- 3 min at 28 C) and is further slowed ({\textless} or =7-fold) by the addition of various ligands. Estrogen antagonists provide greater kinetic stabilization of the {ER} dimers than agonists. In addition, coactivator peptides containing the {LXXLL} motif selectively stabilize agonist-bound {ERalpha}-{LBD} dimers. These fluorescence-based assays for measuring the kinetic and thermodynamic stability of {ER} dimers provide a functional in vitro method for assessing the agonist or antagonist character of novel ligands.},

Readme for data csvs

Pike 11 3b 1600 is mislabeled, it is the data for Pike 11 3b 387. The csv
labeled Pike 11 3b 387 is a copy of the data from Pike 11 3b 12k.

I have renamed the 1600 csv as 387 and removed the original 387 and replaced it
with a csv generated from the original data library saved on google drive.
